=== Jujutsu Kaisen / 呪術廻戦 ===
Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji Itadori spends his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather. However, this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a cursed item. Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the world of Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said item, revealed to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the ""King of Curses."" Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own newfound powers. Introduced to the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, he begins to walk down a path from which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer. [ Genre : Action, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Shounen, School ]


=== Onimai : I'm now your sister! ===
Mahiro Oyama was just a normal erotic-game loving dude...until he woke up one morning as a woman! Turns out his mad-scientist little sister, Mihari, tried out one of her new experiments on him...with a disastrous outcome, as far as Mahiro's concerned! But Mihari is as determined to study him as he is determined to go back to his shut-in, game-playing life, and one thing's for sure...life is going to get a whole lot weirder from here on out! [ Genre :  Comedy, Slice of Life ]

＜Lyric＞
ランドリー今日はガラ空きでラッキーデイ
Laundromat’s empty, must be my lucky day
かったりい油汚れもこれでバイバイ
It’s about time I said buh-bye to this crud

誰だ誰だ頭の中 呼びかける声は
Who is it, who’s whispering in my head,
あれが欲しいこれが欲しいと歌っている
the greedy voices keep singing, begging for more

幸せになりたい 楽して生きていたい
I just want to be satisfied, doing the bare minimum
この手に掴みたい あなたのその胸の中
I want to grab that heart of yours with my bare hands

ハッピーで埋め尽くして レストインピースまで行こうぜ
Let’s fill it up with “happy,” until we rest in peace
いつかみた地獄もいいところ 愛をばら撒いて
That glimpse of hell isn’t so bad, scatter it with love
アイラブユー貶してくれ 全部奪って笑ってくれマイハニー
I love you, please humiliate me. Rob me of my dignity and laugh my honey
努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
GRIND, FUTURE, A BEAUTIFUL STAR
なんか忘れちゃってんだ
I think my screw’s coming loose

4443で外れる炭酸水
4443, another opportunity lost
ハングリー拗らせて吐きそうな人生
I’ve been so hungry to the core, I could vomit

「止まない雨はない」より先に その傘をくれよ
“Rainy days never stay”? Hand over your umbrella
あれが欲しい これが欲しい 全て欲しい ただ虚しい
Give me all of it, I want it all. The more I crave, an empty void consumes me

幸せになりたい 楽して生きていたい
I just want to be satisfied, doing the bare minimum
全部滅茶苦茶にしたい 何もかも消し去りたい 
I want to sabotage it all, wipe it out clean
あなたのその胸の中
Even that heart of yours

ラッキーで埋め尽くして レストインピースまで行こうぜ
Let’s fill it up with luck, go until we rest in peace
良い子だけ迎える天国じゃ どうも生きらんない
A heaven only for the righteous? That’s no way to live
アイラブユー貶して奪って笑ってくれマイハニー
I love you, please humiliate me. Rob me of my dignity and laugh, my honey
努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
GRIND, FUTURE, A BEAUTIFUL STAR
なんか忘れちゃってんだ
I think my screw’s coming loose

ハッピー ラッキー こんにちはベイビー  (ハッピー ラッキー こんにちはベイビー)
Happy. Lucky. Konnichiwa baby                [ Happy. Lucky. Konnichiwa baby ]
良い子でいたい そりゃつまらない　  　(あなたの未来 そりゃつまらない)
Upright and noble? That’s boring              [ A future like that, so boring ]
ハッピー ラッキー こんにちはベイビーソースイート
Happy. Lucky. Konnichiwa baby, so sweet
(ハッピー ラッキー こんにちはベイビーソースイート)
[ Happy. Lucky. Konnichiwa baby, so sweet ]
努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
GRIND, FUTURE, A BEAUTIFUL STAR
なんかすごい良い感じ
I’m getting a kick out of it

This is the last one guys. Its been fun but I truly do not care about speedster logic that much. Or most super hero logic. Infinity war features doctor strange who should have been able to freeze time, cut thanos' arms off with his portals, and win. But he didn't. And I still like infinity war. 6-7/10 for sure. Its obviously a dumb moment when something dumb happens but its not as bad as character assasination or boring ahh writing. So yeah. I've never lowered a score based on a bad logic moment is what im saying. Although it is annoying and objectively embarrassing. Dudes defending it are usually wrong. 

But yeah some dude told me to not be so hard on people who deny basic logic. Because aparently they were my audience. And no. They are not. But also i can't be too sure on these new views. I love you guys but i don't really know how I can please you. I don't wanna make more speedster videos. Not because i burnt out but because theres not much more for me to say. If you wanna see breakdowns on other speedsters you can watch madvocate. Because he deserves it. He basically came up with this and he's the one who does it. Plus since logic is mostly objective what would I be adding? But yeah my orignal video was supposed to be good but i didn't expect it to get views.

Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. Walter turns to a life of crime, partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and distributing crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. According to Gilligan, the title is a Southern colloquialism meaning ""to raise hell"".

Better Call Saul is an American crime drama television series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a spin-off, prequel, and a sequel of Gilligan's previous series, Breaking Bad. Set primarily in the early to middle part of the first decade of the 2000s in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series develops Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an earnest lawyer and former con artist, into a greedy criminal defense attorney known as Saul Goodman. Also shown is the moral decline of retired police officer Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who becomes closely affiliated with the Juarez drug cartel to support his granddaughter and her widowed mother. Jimmy and Mike's interactions remain sporadic until their respective storylines fully converge. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date. A sixth and final season, consisting of 13 episodes, is set to premiere in mid-2022.",xmILSoHMIa8,"{'date': '2023-09-25T10:06:06.215Z', 'thumbnail': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xmILSoHMIa8/hqdefault.jpg', 'views': '39222', 'likes': '537'}",LINKO shop 一站式 智能 電子產品網店,"一個網站，有齊至新至潮嘅 電子產品

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt, based on video game designer Mike Pondsmith's game series. Set in a dystopian Cyberpunk universe, the player assumes the role of ""V"" (played by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary in the fictional Californian city known as ""Night City"", where they deal with the fallout from a heist gone wrong that results in an experimental cybernetic ""bio-chip"" containing an engram of the legendary rock star and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) threatening to slowly overwrite V's mind; as the story progresses V and Johnny must work together to find a way to be separated and save V's life.

The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016). The game was developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves had a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin Przybyłowicz, and featured the contributions of several licensed artists. After years of anticipation, CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.

Cyberpunk 2077 received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics. However, some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism. It was also widely criticized for bugs, particularly in the console versions which suffered from performance problems. Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems. CD Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85 million. By September 2022, the game has sold more than 20 million copies. An expansion, Phantom Liberty, is set to release on 26 September 2023 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A sequel was announced.

Season Three - Episode Two: ""Caballo Sin Nombre""

Episode Description:
Walt tries to reconcile with Skyler, but when his advances are rejected he takes drastic action to bring his family back together. A confused and angry Walter, Jr. lashes out at his mother.  With the help of Saul, Jesse makes a significant investment.

Episode Overview:
Already near the breaking point as a result of the divorce, Walt is pushed over the edge when he is stopped by an Albuquerque cop because of a broken car windshield caused by debris from the recent airline disaster. Arrested for his pigheadedness, Walt calls Hank to help him out of his jam and, after apologizing to the arresting officer, returns to his motel to find Saul Goodman, the lawyer who helped him and Jesse sell their meth supply to Gus. Though Walt wants no part of any more drug deals now that he is trying to win Skyler back, Saul urges him to keep an open mind. And to make sure Skyler doesn’t interfere, Saul sends his private detective, Mike, to follow her. Meanwhile, after returning to his parents’ house, Jesse discovers that they are putting it up for sale.

In the face of Marie and Hank’s questions about the divorce, Skyler refuses to reveal anything about Walt’s involvement with drugs. As Mike monitors Skyler’s whereabouts, Saul delivers Jesse’s share of the drug deal cash and asks him to keep an eye on Walt. However, while Jesse is noncommittal about keeping tabs on his ex-partner, he does have a job for Saul. Meanwhile, at a New Mexico nursing home, the cartel hit men, the Cousins, listen as Tio Pepe, the uncle of the drug boss Tuco, fingers Walt for his nephew’s death. And as Skyler looks to put her life back together, she discovers that she still must contend with the financial misdeeds and romantic interests of her boss, Ted Beneke.

Still unhappy over his dad being thrown out, Walt, Jr. comes to live at the motel. Yet, seeing it as an opportunity to talk with Skyler, Walt insists on bringing their son home. Meanwhile, on behalf of a client, Saul offers the Pinkmans half of what they are asking for their house. And after the lawyer threatens to reveal that it used to be home to a meth lab, he gets his low ball price for his client – Jesse. Finally, unable to convince Skyler to discuss his returning home, Walt breaks in after he just misses catching Mike placing a listening device in Skyler’s house – and narrowly avoids being killed when the Cousins’ mission is called off at the last minute.

マーシャル・マキシマイザー

唖々、臨界実験に付き合う朝
14听（ポンド）を嗤う蔑奴（ベッド）
「如何しようもないけど」
気が狂うヒトの振りをしているキミを観ている

唖々、面倒だったから切り捨てた
4U型（サイズ）を攫う烙句（ラック）
「申し訳ないけど」
擦れ違うモノに無為に期待を背負わせている

「夜更かしはイドの暴走」
「目に焼き付いた青の感光」
「モラトリアム的人生」
「最大公約数緩衝材」

食べてすぐ寝て丑になる 
起きてまた寝て人でなし？

「失敗！（Fail）」
マキシマイザー マキシマイザー！
急転 相まって壊したってDEAD強行！
「なんてことだ！死んでしまう！」
だがツマミは回る雁字搦MATE！

「無間地獄へ堕ちる！堕ちる！」
But a 眩みUnbalance 乖離Faraway！

唖々、生還 実験に繰り出すアラーム
旧四ロンドを微笑(わら)う劣等
「如何しようもないから」
気が狂うヒトの真似をしているキミへ

「簡単な言葉、信じていたいなら」
——足りないよ。
「申し訳ないなら」
——既に合う音に不意に解は求まんないよ。

「後悔はエゴの暴走」
「手に焼き付いた青の残像」
「モラトリアム的人間」
「最小公倍数断頭台」

食べてすぐ寝て丑になる 
起きてまた寝て人でなし？

「参っちまうな、マキシマイザー」
救世 愛待って焦がしたってFADE凶行
「なんてことだ、生きてしまう」
だが恨み逆巻く惨事またGATE

Doctor Strange recently appeared in Spider-Man: No Way Home to cast a very important spell. And, pretty soon we can look forward to seeing his sequel, in the Multiverse of Madness. But you should really revisit the first film, because it is criminally underrated. The film is a masterpiece of visuals, character drama, and hidden symbolism. And it deserves its place among Marvel's best.

It isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but it was a Hail Mary that (for the most part) succeeded.

Synopsis:
Violent misfortunes frequently occur around 16-year-old Yuuta Okkotsu, a timid victim of high school bullying. Yuuta is saddled with a monstrous curse, a power that dishes out brutal revenge against his bullies. Rika Orimoto, Yuuta's curse, is a shadow from his tragic childhood and a potentially lethal threat to anyone who dares wrong him.

Yuuta's unique situation catches the attention of Satoru Gojou, a powerful sorcerer who teaches at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Gojou sees immense potential in Yuuta, and he hopes to help the boy channel his deadly burden into a force for good. Yet Yuuta struggles to find his place among his talented classmates: the selectively mute Toge Inumaki, weapons expert Maki Zenin, and Panda.

Yuuta clumsily utilizes Rika on missions with the other first-year students, but the grisly aftermath of Rika's tremendous displays of power draws the interest of the calculating curse user Suguru Getou. As Getou strives to claim Rika's strength and use it to eliminate all non-jujutsu users from the world, Yuuta fights alongside his friends to stop the genocidal plot.

Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Movie covers manga chapters 0.1-0.4.

On the date of the premier in Japan, December 24, 2021, guests recieved a tie-in booklet dubbed ""Volume 0.5.""

Better Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White's lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is ""fixer"" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts ""criminal"" in ""criminal lawyer.""

The chase led to Tulara Ravine, and the two Twi’leks spotted the Ghost coming in to scoop them up after making a difficult supply run. Charging back towards their pursuers, the Ghost took out the armored transport and scooped up Cham and Numa along with the Blurggs and a Scout Trooper. As they flew away, Cham brought up some bad news for Hera; the Empire now occupied the Tann Province which was where Hera grew up. Cham and his followers fought hard to defend their home against the Imperials led by Captain Slavin. He described his previous attacks to be clumsy which gave Cham an advantage in keeping the Empire from taking their home. But he underestimated his recent attack, which was swift and precise. Cham lost Tann Province to the Empire which had now been turned into an Imperial headquarters for Captain Slavin. He and his followers escaped but left behind family treasures. One treasure specifically left behind was known as the Kalikori; a Twi'kel totem that was passed on from family generation to generation. Hera was next in line to inherit the Kalikori owned by the Syndulla family. Hera vowed to get it back for the sake of her mother.

The internet's arguably most famous feline, Grumpy Cat, was invited for an in-depth interview, but showed herself unimpressed with Stefanovic's interrogation.

The host grilled his guest about her fame, her upcoming book, and about Australian politics; all questions she stoically frowned upon. (She is a cat after all.)

Stefanovic bravely played along for a while before cracking up after the cat pulled a particularly grumpy face when Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott was mentioned.

Grumpy Cat rose to internet fame last year after Bryan Bundesen, the brother of Grumpy Cat's owner, Tabatha Bundesen, posted some pics of the cat (real name Tardar Sauce) on Reddit.

""It was an accident,"" Bundesen said. ""We thought it would get some laughs, with the Internet liking cats. And it just kept going.""

There's no doubting Grumpy Cat's star power:

It is the sixth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to be produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. Slater serves as head writer with Mohamed Diab leading the directing team.

Oscar Isaac stars as Marc Spector / Moon Knight, a mercenary who has dissociative identity disorder, with May Calamawy, Karim El-Hakim, F. Murray Abraham, and Ethan Hawke also starring. The series was announced in August 2019, with Slater hired in November. Diab was hired to direct four episodes in October 2020, with directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead joining in January 2021 to direct the other two. Isaac was confirmed to star at that time, and used different accents to differentiate Spector's various identities. Filming took place from April to October 2021, primarily in Budapest as well as in Jordan, Slovenia, and Atlanta, Georgia.

Moon Knight premiered on March 30, 2022, and is scheduled to run for six episodes until May 4. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU.

Train
""50 Ways To Say Goodbye""

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Bridge]
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love...
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

The idea is to try and praise the film for the things I thought were great while leaving the flaws out of the analysis, basically the complete inverse of what you often see on the channel. 

I will pick this back up with other films if you guys enjoy it, I really tried to nail the editing and the script though I wanted to get it out quick to cover the topic.

マーシャル・マキシマイザー

唖々、臨界実験に付き合う朝
14听（ポンド）を嗤う蔑奴（ベッド）
「如何しようもないけど」
気が狂うヒトの振りをしているキミを観ている

唖々、面倒だったから切り捨てた
4U型（サイズ）を攫う烙句（ラック）
「申し訳ないけど」
擦れ違うモノに無為に期待を背負わせている

「夜更かしはイドの暴走」
「目に焼き付いた青の感光」
「モラトリアム的人生」
「最大公約数緩衝材」

食べてすぐ寝て丑になる 
起きてまた寝て人でなし？

「失敗！（Fail）」
マキシマイザー マキシマイザー！
急転 相まって壊したってDEAD強行！
「なんてことだ！死んでしまう！」
だがツマミは回る雁字搦MATE！

サンクコスター サンクコステス！
同位体 終（しま）いには取り戻したい！って
「無間地獄へ堕ちる！堕ちる！」
But a 眩みUnbalance 乖離Faraway！

唖々、生還 実験に繰り出すアラーム
旧四ロンドを微笑(わら)う劣等
「如何しようもないから」
気が狂うヒトの真似をしているキミへ

「簡単な言葉、信じていたいなら」
——足りないよ。
「申し訳ないなら」
——既に合う音に不意に解は求まんないよ。

「後悔はエゴの暴走」
「手に焼き付いた青の残像」
「モラトリアム的人間」
「最小公倍数断頭台」

食べてすぐ寝て丑になる 
起きてまた寝て人でなし？

「参っちまうな、マキシマイザー」
救世 愛待って焦がしたってFADE凶行
「なんてことだ、生きてしまう」
だが恨み逆巻く惨事またGATE

「失敗！（Fail）」
マキシマイザー マキシマイザー！
急転 相まって壊したってDEAD強行！
「なんてことだ！死んでしまう！」
だがツマミは回る雁字搦MATE！

Ben Reilly, also known as the amazing Scarlet Spider, is a wonderfully fun ken-doll himbo in the new hit film - Across the Spider Verse.

And you know what? That's okay.

I understand that a lot of Scarlet Spider fans are rightfully upset with how he was handled in the film, but I've had a chance to sit back and take a better look at the whole situation. Sure, Ben has had a rough string of bad luck with Spider-Man Beyond and becoming Chasm, but to me this is a lot better than that. Having everyone's favorite blonde webhead be a bouncy, muscular bro in a feature film is a far cry from how Marvel has been treating him in the comics.

This is a fanmade recreation of the OPLA trailer using anime footage.

I'll always prefer the old animation style, but I wanted more scenes to choose from, so I went with the anime specials - Episode of Nami, Episode of East Blue, and Episode of Merry. I also used One Piece movie 5 + some random filler episodes with reanimated east blue content, hence the different art styles in every shot lol. It's not exactly a 1:1 recreation of the Netflix trailer, though I followed it pretty closely.

New episodes of LUCKY HANK premiere Sundays at 9pm on AMC, catch up any time on AMC+.

Better Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White's lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is ""fixer"" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts ""criminal"" in ""criminal lawyer.""

J.K. Simmons portrayal of Terence Fletcher will forever be one of the most terrifying and chilling representations of the mental stress a teacher can put on a student.  Terence Fletcher is a manipulative and sociopathic teacher at a top music school, using his tactics to bend the will of his students into what he believes is greatness.  Whiplash would not hold the weight it does without Terence Fletcher's insanity on screen.

You can find the episode here: http://johnaugust.com/2015/whiplash-on-paper-and-on-screen

Pay particular attention to verb tenses. Fletcher (JK Simmons) moves a lot of things into the past. 

A big chunk is lifted from the back half of the scene, likely because it doesn't focus directly on Andrew and Fletcher's relationship in the present and future.

You can find the Scriptnotes podcast on iTunes.

Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith

Years after the onset of the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights lead a massive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the Separatists. When the sinister Sith unveil a thousand-year-old plot to rule the galaxy, the Republic crumbles and from its ashes rises the evil Galactic Empire. Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker is seduced by the dark side of the Force to become the Emperor’s new apprentice – Darth Vader. The Jedi are decimated, as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Master Yoda are forced into hiding. The only hope for the galaxy are Anakin’s own offspring – the twin children born in secrecy who will grow up to become heroes.

Starting with both Dave Filoni and James Mangold set to direct two separate upcoming Star Wars films. Detailing what we can expect further from each director, Filoni’s movie will apparently close out the New Republic, tying up the stories told within the Disney Plus shows, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and the upcoming Ahsoka series. For Filoni, this’ll be a great way for the interconnected stories we’ve seen play out on the Disney Plus live-action offerings with Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, and soon Ashoka, to tie up any loose ends left on the small screen, and potentially bring these characters together for a galactic battle fit for theaters. That’s a tall order, but if anyone’s up to the task, it’s Dave Filoni, who was a protegé of George Lucas’ prior to the Disney era of #StarWars. And finally, John Leguzamo has no plans to see the Super Mario Bros. movie.

A full 4K HDR (and 1080p) upscale of the entire series, also taking all but 9 episodes and re-cutting them seamlessly into feature films for every single arc. Have a favorite arc? Order 66? The Rako Hardeen Deception Arc? Mortis? The Nightsisters? Yoda's Journey? Maul's Revenge? This project converts the entire TV show into the definitive theatrical experience, perfect for your nice 4K HDR theater setup.

I have also reordered the episodes to fit a (mostly) chronological order based on the entire series official order list. This fixes many, many continuity problems for those who get confused when they watch it in viewing order. There are some minor alterations to the official episode order to make these arcs work as films, but any changes to the official chronological order are small (Putting Maul's Season 4 and 5 arcs into a single epic 3 hour cut, moving the lone episode ""A Friend in Need"" up a bit in the timeline to fit with the Heroes on Both Sides arc. Making Cad Bane's seasons 1-3 arc into a single supercut). The rest of the alterations follow the official continuity order (2 season 1 and 2 episodes are now part of the extended Clone Wars Theatrical Film Cut due to them being part of the Battle of Christophsis, ect. ect.) and greatly enhance the show's viewing experience.

Its tragedy contrasts so intensely with the trilogy's initial whimsy.

A full 4K HDR (and 1080p) upscale of the entire series, also taking all but 9 episodes and re-cutting them seamlessly into feature films for every single arc. Have a favorite arc? Order 66? The Rako Hardeen Deception Arc? Mortis? The Nightsisters? Yoda's Journey? Maul's Revenge? This project converts the entire TV show into the definitive theatrical experience, perfect for your nice 4K HDR theater setup.

I have also reordered the episodes to fit a (mostly) chronological order based on the entire series official order list. This fixes many, many continuity problems for those who get confused when they watch it in viewing order. There are some minor alterations to the official episode order to make these arcs work as films, but any changes to the official chronological order are small (Putting Maul's Season 4 and 5 arcs into a single epic 3 hour cut, moving the lone episode ""A Friend in Need"" up a bit in the timeline to fit with the Heroes on Both Sides arc. Making Cad Bane's seasons 1-3 arc into a single supercut). The rest of the alterations follow the official continuity order (2 season 1 and 2 episodes are now part of the extended Clone Wars Theatrical Film Cut due to them being part of the Battle of Christophsis, ect. ect.) and greatly enhance the show's viewing experience.

Towards the end of Obi-Wan Kenobi second episode, Reva (Moses Ingram), an Inquisitor hunting down Jedi, reveals to Obi-Wan that Anakin is still alive after being left to die in the ashes of Mustafar. Now ruling the Empire as Lord Vader, Reva warns Obi-Wan he won’t be able to hide from him forever.

In the closing moments, Obi-Wan is clearly distressed by the news, having assumed he’d died after their duel. “Anakin,” he utters, before it cuts to Anakin in his bacta tank, surrounding by water and apparatus.

Lyrics:
Kaw kaw, begin the tests, critical the theories all
Leave me delirious inside my head
“Guess there’s nothing more to be said”
I’ve got you read, a sober puppeteer playing the fool to the end
Kaw kaw, a pain through and through
I’ll start anew, and tear away this scribbled size 4U
“Sorry, but I cannot approve”
I kill the mood of scenes I see no matter what that I do

“Night is the noose of ego”
“Now the azure is all I see though”
“Moratorium management models life”
“The wrappings keep it so”

If you sleep after eating you’ll become a beast
Are you savage if you fade out back to sleep

Fail
Maximizer, maximizer
Though I break where it matters, still I’m in a hearse now
“God almighty, am I running late?”
Will I die here bound together, the handle turning, mate?
Sunken coaster, sunken coasting miss
How I wish I could fix it, the isotope’s corrupting
“Down to hell you’re falling in a haze”
But a dazzling unbalance disturbs you faraway

Kaw kaw, return to life, a dinging sound dissipates
To tell the testing will begin in time
“Guess there’s nothing more we can do”
I say to you, oh personing mimicking—a tired fool

“If you want to trust the simple slipping words you hear”
—Remains unclear
“If you’re really sorry, my dear”
—You can’t expect a solution to simply snap and just appear

“Heartbreak hampers the ego”
“Now the azure is all I feel though”
“Moratorium management models life”
“A guillotine in rows”

If you sleep after eating you’ll become a beast
Are you savage if you fade out back to sleep

“Man, you got me, Maximizer”
Burning dreams and salvation, simmer into murder
“God almighty, live another day”
But resentment so rightly surges down into the gate
Fail
Maximizer, maximizer
Though I break where it matters, still I’m in a hearse now
“God almighty, am I running late?”
Will I die here bound together, the handle turning, mate?
Sunken coaster, sunken coasting miss
How I wish I could fix it, the isotope’s corrupting
“Down to hell you’re falling in a haze”
But a dazzling unbalance disturbs you faraway
Maximizer, maximizer
Maximizer, maximizer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This video was made to go a long side a *Twitter thread* that I made for my friends to document some of GameTheory's mistakes. This video was NOT made to criticize Mathew as a person, or hurt his reputation, but reflect on *his lack of accountability* for mistakes. Time and Time again MatPat has disappointed his fans. If I could redo this video I would, I would focus on him lying about someone's suicide and how he refuses to apologize for donating to anti-autistic charity organizations. 

I was simply calling him hypercritical for claiming he cares but being unable to listen or even *apologize*. I plan on making an actual indepth video about all of this.


do NOT go and harass MatPat, or anyone in the comments, I do not condone attacking him. This is not me trying to cancel him, THIS WILL NOT AFFECT MATPAT AT ALL. If you think this video will stain his ""good image"" you are very wrong. I don't think he will care nor will any of his loyal fans care either.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Might not be literally every time he's said those words anywhere, but at least every time he ends a main channel video with the catchphrase.
In case anyone wonders, this is a total of 377 video outros synced up. A surprising bit lower than the total videos on the channel (currently total 643, so about 58.6 %), but quite many had wording variations, were narrated by other hosts with other outros, or otherwise lacked the exact catchphrase.

I don't even watch this guy that much... this was just goofy shitpost project that I wanted to make for no good reason. And I genuinely had to wait until I upgraded my PC to make it – turns playing hundreds of videos at once requires powerful hardware. (It still bluscreened several times while exporting.)

I uploaded this in 8K 60fps preserve all the glorious theorizing quality (each original are 1080p 60fps), but somehow it took YouTube several weeks to make that resolution available. Oh well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After his father passes away, Ith opens a mysterious package delivered to his house. He accidentally turns on and pairs with a state-of-the-art robot doll. Uncle Jean, the robot’s creator, says the student needs to use the doll in order for the investors to approve mass production. Since he’s already paired with the robot, no one else can fulfill the objective. If he fails, they’ll have to pay back 50 million baht to each investors. However, Ith's inexperience severely complicates matters.
