0,4mdL9QYEjVc,2023-09-26T02:54:39Z,This detail is frankly BAFFLING,A new look at Baylan's wrist indicates that he may be hunting Star Wars characters we all know and love. All that and more discussed on today's Star Wars video!,so I gotta say I'm usually pretty good at spotting and decoding orabesh but I didn't see this Twitter however did and the first place I saw this was from user at Nira underscore 592 who said people why is nobody talking about this showing what was one of the few good close-up shots of phelan's wrist and on it he has orabesh with the name of some people you may know including Luke Leia Han Chewie R2D2 C3PO and Ben now many people have speculated what could this mean and it's certainly possible that this is some form of Hit List Valen seems to have some weird sentiments about the fall of the Jedi or could see the Skywalker family as contributing to the endless cycle of violence the galaxy has experienced or more likely the people designing his armor just needed something to take up space on his Gauntlet and it was a fun way to throw in an Easter egg which will mean literally nothing to most fans interestingly however this is not the only bit of decoding fans have done in got another short coming soon about some messages hidden in the most recent episode of Ahsoka or maybe by the time it releases the second most recent episode if you've got a guess let me know down below 
1,yuozW1tQiMc,2023-09-26T00:23:08Z,This will be difficult to watch…,"The latest episode of Ahsoka is setting up Baylan for a mighty fall. But what exactly is it?...

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",the next episode of Ahsoka is going to be difficult to watch especially around this character Balin is a very captivating character in Ahsoka despite being a very knowledgeable dark Jedi we know very little about his intentions what we know so far is that he's aware of a great power outside of the Star Wars Galaxy that will enable him and his Apprentice Shin to reach a power you couldn't even dream of this unknown entity is no doubt the same power that thrawn and Knight sisters are trying to escape from essentially scaring the empire into a retreat Balin states that this has the potential to end the power struggle that exists between the Republic and the Empire how it can be harnessed is unknown this lack of information suggests Baylin has no idea what he's got himself into and it's either a power struggle that will destroy him or consume him Beyond his control this matches a similar Theory we made in a previous video about the zepho who we know resided on this creepy Planet years ago but not one can be found on the surface perhaps this greater power also destroyed or consumed them so whichever way you look at it is going to be difficult to watch a brilliant character like bailin fall to the power he wishes to possess but what do you think let me know in the comments down below or for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now 
2,g3Dk7u-m9NU,2023-08-23T05:49:58Z,"An actual, genuine, earnest, real, deliberately chosen and used sound effect in Breaking Bad","if you look closely in this scene, you will notice walter white is standing in front of what appears to be a green wall. this is no coincidence: astute watchers will connect the dots to the subtle hints dropped throughout the show that walter white is a teacher. Such walls are known as ""blackboards"", and are common in american schools, where teachers tend to teach.",yes Ben is this going to be on the murder

＜Lyric＞
ランドリー今日はガラ空きでラッキーデイ
Laundromat’s empty, must be my lucky day
かったりい油汚れもこれでバイバイ
It’s about time I said buh-bye to this crud

誰だ誰だ頭の中 呼びかける声は
Who is it, who’s whispering in my head,
あれが欲しいこれが欲しいと歌っている
the greedy voices keep singing, begging for more

幸せになりたい 楽して生きていたい
I just want to be satisfied, doing the bare minimum
この手に掴みたい あなたのその胸の中
I want to grab that heart of yours with my bare hands

ハッピーで埋め尽くして レストインピースまで行こうぜ
Let’s fill it up with “happy,” until we rest in peace
いつかみた地獄もいいところ 愛をばら撒いて
That glimpse of hell isn’t so bad, scatter it with love
アイラブユー貶してくれ 全部奪って笑ってくれマイハニー
I love you, please humiliate me. Rob me of my dignity and laugh my honey
努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
GRIND, FUTURE, A BEAUTIFUL STAR
なんか忘れちゃってんだ
I think my screw’s coming loose

4443で外れる炭酸水
4443, another opportunity lost
ハングリー拗らせて吐きそうな人生
I’ve been so hungry to the core, I could vomit

「止まない雨はない」より先に その傘をくれよ
“Rainy days never stay”? Hand over your umbrella
あれが欲しい これが欲しい 全て欲しい ただ虚しい
Give me all of it, I want it all. The more I crave, an empty void consumes me

幸せになりたい 楽して生きていたい
I just want to be satisfied, doing the bare minimum
全部滅茶苦茶にしたい 何もかも消し去りたい 
I want to sabotage it all, wipe it out clean
あなたのその胸の中
Even that heart of yours

ラッキーで埋め尽くして レストインピースまで行こうぜ
Let’s fill it up with luck, go until we rest in peace
良い子だけ迎える天国じゃ どうも生きらんない
A heaven only for the righteous? That’s no way to live
アイラブユー貶して奪って笑ってくれマイハニー
I love you, please humiliate me. Rob me of my dignity and laugh, my honey
努力 未来 A BEAUTIFUL STAR
GRIND, FUTURE, A BEAUTIFUL STAR
なんか忘れちゃってんだ
I think my screw’s coming loose

ハッピー ラッキー こんにちはベイビー  (ハッピー ラッキー こんにちはベイビー)
Happy. Lucky. Konnichiwa baby                [ Happy. Lucky. Konnichiwa baby ]
良い子でいたい そりゃつまらない　  　(あなたの未来 そりゃつまらない)

5,7HOLXHNpp70,2019-07-04T23:41:51Z,The Bizarre Beauty of Hachi's Music,"I take a closer look at the bizarre yet beautiful work of one of Vocaloid's most creative minds, Hachi. From the game changing Matryoshka to the compelling World's End Umbrella. Hachi is unlike any other producer in the field. If you like my video feel free to subscribe thanks!

listening to it have you said messy chaotic or noisy I couldn't really blame you this is a song called panda hero and it's one of the most bizarre songs I have ever listened to or seen on niconico it's unapologetically creepy the production is messing and jarring and heck even the diva lesson at the beginning this song is wrong and yet it's one of my favorite songs ever let alone one of my favorite music videos of all time as well here let me explain for all this weirdness there's a strange sense of curiosity and all this song instills in me yes the production is messy but here's the thing it's purposefully messy this was clearly done by someone who wanted to put their audience on edge someone who wanted to make them uncomfortable and is still emotion in you and the music video perfectly complements this when the two are combined and almost makes it look like the images on the screen are going to come out of the page it's immersive if I had to describe panda hero in one word I would say that is grimy and that's the point one listen to this song and you could tell this wasn't done by an amateur this was done by someone who wanted to make something that would stick with their audience and that in his essence is the bizarre genius of hachis music for those of you who don't know who hot she is he's a Vocaloid producer if you joined nico nico in 2009 who quickly went on to make some of the most iconic songs at Vocaloid history Mockridge Inca Panda hero donut hole dune that last one I mentioned dune post a record for the fastest video to reach 1 million views on niconico but here's the catch it was only released two years ago it completes 6 years after his crime a testament to his immense popularity in the community but that's not all even after leaving Vocaloid to pursue a career under his real name of Kenzi Yanni soon he would rise become one too biggest pop symbols arguably making him the most successful person period that started with Vocaloid the popularity doesn't happen without a reason so what made Hachi so unique compared to other producers well the thing that made him stand out is well he actually has no style when it comes to music I'm like when I talked about well wakka during my last video each song that Hachi puts out is completely different from the last in fact before I was a fan I had no idea that donut hole was even made by the same man in me ma crow shankha however some of his most popular songs around 2009 the 2011 do you follow a trend and as their dark tone and themes that drastically stood out compared to the cut pop those being posted at the time the messy and rough production was a huge contrast and easily made him stand out the subject matter of his songs for the most part was always hard to swallow even for Vocaloid today which is known for having some pretty dark stuff prostitution drugs kidnapping those are just a small number of the themes that have been hinted at in the lyrics of the songs but there was something disturbing but oddly fascinating about hafiz music a big part of his music is about reading between the lines his lyrics are famous for being in direct and fully up for interpretation but maybe some of you were thinking well it can't be all the songs right you know now that I think about it maybe you're right what's like a doughnut hole for example I mean donut hole is clearly a song about trying to remember a dead loved one right or is it I mean there are clearly lines in this I would definitely say about someone I love but others seem a bit off okay well maybe they were dying and these were their last words well no because then you have this line here [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is clearly something I want to say if I knew someone was gone if anything it suggested that their pain on the matter has changed so clearly I don't understand what's being said and done at home but do I need to well if I did I promise you I probably wouldn't be talking about this song six years later possibly one of my favorite aspects of hachis music is his music videos hachis music videos almost seemed like an extension of his songs I'm not necessarily saying they're necessary to enjoy his music they're not but I feel like I get a better idea of the toner idea he was trying to give when I watched them for example while I wasn't Mach rushing come music video the bright colors like the yellows and the neon greens help display emotions of high energy which in turn helps me better understand the utter chaos of the lyrics when I listen to whole release ricksaw song carcasses the dark blacks and reds help me understand the ominous nature of the song these music videos are helping to express the atmosphere the artist intended when writing the song now in comparison let's look at dig of twenty-seventh music videos and while I love deco 27 music and he has some great 'rememorable music videos over the years I never really felt like I was getting more from watching his music videos you know typically DSC F is the first one that comes to my mind when I think about this as a great song and the music video is absolutely beautiful but honestly I don't feel like I'm gaining more from watching it it's mostly just eye candy but when I watch the hachi music video it's all about reading between the lines just like I said with his lyrics and they're just full of so many small details that I just want to scratch my brain thinking about them like why does give me space change at the last second or Macra shinka or were they really reaching for it towards the end of donut hole when I watch his music videos it always makes me want to ask myself as there's something more going on here and I think there is something to be said for artists who can make their own videos like Hachi I know this isn't a Vocaloid song but whenever I think about the attention of detail he puts into his work I can't help but always think about the iodine a music video and how he talked about the process was so daunting on his hands that he got repetitive strain injury just from it it goes to show you that for producers it's more than just talent passion and hard work or equally as needed to a vision now earlier I stated that his song from 2009 the 2011 shared a common theme and that was the dark tone and while his later sounds like donut hole in dune are not exactly happy songs they're not nearly as darkest a DNA or miss pumpkins comical dream so why is that well in my opinion I think that's because the mindset Hoshi is in now it's much different from his mindset during that time period to understand what I really mean though let's take a closer look at its past from a young age hot he was always focused on making music he had no interest in school and primarily he spent his time writing lyrics in his notebook during class in fact he actually said he would calculate how many times he could skip his classes without failing every year but there were other reasons for this as well he struggled to communicate with others and was often jealous of how easily his classmates could do it it made him feel like a monster always standing out from everyone else and the make matters worse he lived in emotionally and physically poor household now I want you to listen to this over the course of 25 years he has probably spoken to his dad a total of an hour and yes he did live with him imagine living in the same house or what as your parents and you've only spoken to them the same length that your professor but give a lecture at the end of 20 he'd be Dinah's with high-functioning autism it was a sigh of relief for him to know that he wasn't the reason for everything that he wasn't the problem but unfortunately that didn't mean life was gonna get any easier eventually he left for college in Osaka but dropped out after a year around this time though he discovered Vocaloid and posted his first song in 2009 for the next two the three years his world was nico nico and that's no exaggeration the only time he left a house was literally to go to the supermarket he finally found an audience that would listen to his music and it meant everything to him but maybe a little too much while home released rickshaw and carcasses would be his first on the break a million views it would also be the point that its current girlfriend will leave him for focusing on nico nico too much and about halfway through his career he had this nagging feeling in the back of his mind was his Vocaloid thing really alright should I be doing something else instead one day he finally came to realization that he was alone he had his fans but no one was in his actual life and he felt that he made the wrong choice over the past couple of years he lost a while to live and fell into a deep depression for the next year he has spent his free time doing nothing but watching gaming videos and sleeping information from the outside was even too painful for him he said the only thing that kept him going was his Twitter and the videos he had posted on nico nico hochy is my favorite producer of all time I love the dark themes of his earlier work and is almost a sane sense of imagination however I would give that up any day if it meant that he didn't have to go through what he did those eight years ago it's hard to not look back at his music and think that the negative themes surrounding his work was not a result of his mental struggles like a cry of help from someone who didn't understand the point of why is this and while hot tea would eventually pull himself out of his depression as he continued to pursue his career as he owned a zoo I can't help but look back on my favorite songs every ask myself again is there really something more going on here thanks for watching [Applause] [Music] hey there open up here this is my second video and as I mentioned earlier hot cheese my favorite producer of all time so it was really cool to finally get the opportunity to make a video about him if any of the music in this video feature interest I got some good news for you both epoxies album's official orange and bouquet and barrel at sea are now officially available on multiple different streaming services as far as I checked they're on Spotify Apple music and YouTube my recommendation would be starting with official Orange it's a great album and probably one of my favorite Vocaloid albums ever that being said if you guys have any advice on how I can keep improving my videos feel free to leave it down in the comments thanks bye

Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. Walter turns to a life of crime, partnering with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and distributing crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. According to Gilligan, the title is a Southern colloquialism meaning ""to raise hell"".

Better Call Saul is an American crime drama television series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a spin-off, prequel, and a sequel of Gilligan's previous series, Breaking Bad. Set primarily in the early to middle part of the first decade of the 2000s in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series develops Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an earnest lawyer and former con artist, into a greedy criminal defense attorney known as Saul Goodman. Also shown is the moral decline of retired police officer Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), who becomes closely affiliated with the Juarez drug cartel to support his granddaughter and her widowed mother. Jimmy and Mike's interactions remain sporadic until their respective storylines fully converge. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date. A sixth and final season, consisting of 13 episodes, is set to premiere in mid-2022.",

Season Three - Episode Two: ""Caballo Sin Nombre""

Episode Description:
Walt tries to reconcile with Skyler, but when his advances are rejected he takes drastic action to bring his family back together. A confused and angry Walter, Jr. lashes out at his mother.  With the help of Saul, Jesse makes a significant investment.

Episode Overview:
Already near the breaking point as a result of the divorce, Walt is pushed over the edge when he is stopped by an Albuquerque cop because of a broken car windshield caused by debris from the recent airline disaster. Arrested for his pigheadedness, Walt calls Hank to help him out of his jam and, after apologizing to the arresting officer, returns to his motel to find Saul Goodman, the lawyer who helped him and Jesse sell their meth supply to Gus. Though Walt wants no part of any more drug deals now that he is trying to win Skyler back, Saul urges him to keep an open mind. And to make sure Skyler doesn’t interfere, Saul sends his private detective, Mike, to follow her. Meanwhile, after returning to his parents’ house, Jesse discovers that they are putting it up for sale.

In the face of Marie and Hank’s questions about the divorce, Skyler refuses to reveal anything about Walt’s involvement with drugs. As Mike monitors Skyler’s whereabouts, Saul delivers Jesse’s share of the drug deal cash and asks him to keep an eye on Walt. However, while Jesse is noncommittal about keeping tabs on his ex-partner, he does have a job for Saul. Meanwhile, at a New Mexico nursing home, the cartel hit men, the Cousins, listen as Tio Pepe, the uncle of the drug boss Tuco, fingers Walt for his nephew’s death. And as Skyler looks to put her life back together, she discovers that she still must contend with the financial misdeeds and romantic interests of her boss, Ted Beneke.

Still unhappy over his dad being thrown out, Walt, Jr. comes to live at the motel. Yet, seeing it as an opportunity to talk with Skyler, Walt insists on bringing their son home. Meanwhile, on behalf of a client, Saul offers the Pinkmans half of what they are asking for their house. And after the lawyer threatens to reveal that it used to be home to a meth lab, he gets his low ball price for his client – Jesse. Finally, unable to convince Skyler to discuss his returning home, Walt breaks in after he just misses catching Mike placing a listening device in Skyler’s house – and narrowly avoids being killed when the Cousins’ mission is called off at the last minute.

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",the latest episode of Ahsoka introduced a new time for Jedi we haven't heard before alien skull dropped the term boken Jedi comes from a breed of Balkan Jedi which is basically any Jedi that's been trained in the wild not part of the Jedi Order which I guess means they've been trained after the fall of the Jedi Order in this sense Ezra Bridger is a broken Jedi but also so is Luke Skywalker so is Rey so is calcustus in some ways I guess he was part of the Jedi Order originally but he also seemed to imply that he sees shinhati as kind of like a Jedi except something more than a Jedi he definitely wasn't leaning towards Darkseid or Sith with her though and the word boken actually has Japanese origin as many of the things in the show do being a Japanese wooden sword used for training so perhaps they're using this word to describe Jedi because they're not training in the real traditional Jedi arts and as part of the Jedi establishment if you enjoyed this please subscribe for more

#spiderman #memes #spiderverse",Spider-Man across the spider-verse is an absolute meme Factory from the first explosive Trend showing up in the form of the bagel effect [Music] to Miles Morales Rises himself up to maybe you should get off that kid's up I'm sorry what what two I'm gonna crease your J's Spider-Man 2 well that was another easy adventure for Spider-Man to count on events to I respect every single Spider-Man in here to thousands of other miscellaneous memes referencing the film there's no doubt it's living up to its predecessor in terms of quote worthy moments and shareable Screen grabs seriously each of the memes I mentioned prior have become so big they deserve their own videos though if I were to discuss each one I wouldn't possibly be able to keep up with the rate that they are popping out hence this video will simply discuss the effect that spider-verse films have had on digital culture at large so what is it about the spider-verse that has the attention of so many digital artists well just as the first movie Spider-man into the spider-verse spawned memes for years after its release in 2018 even to the point where the prowler theme can still be seen in 2023 quite clear the film's vision and Direction were made with a new generation in mind and to be frank these movies just look a whole lot more visually interesting than other Spider-Man iterations that being said the whole spider-verse concept arguably first appeared outside of comics in the 2010 game Shattered Dimensions which received favorable reviews and laid the foundations for many of the characters we see in the films and Comics today Spider-Man and it's worth noting Miles Morales first appeared in a 2011 release of ultimate Fallout wherein he is required to take up the web slinging mantle however due to the films he stars in he's quickly become one of the most recognizable and popular Heroes for the latest generation and rightly so don't get me wrong I absolutely love the other films Toby Maguire's rendition is always my favorite and his representation in the bully Maguire memes indicates this is the case for many others but the Miles Morales Arc initially based on the 2014-2015 comic book event has something many of the other majorly popular films do not this is because this Spider-Man is involved in a project that has changed what audiences thought Cinema could be the animation and art direction of the spider-verse films is like nothing we've ever seen prior to 2018. at least other movies that tried to emulate that comic book style either ended up playing it too safe or take it to a point where it becomes the tackiest part of the visual experience or filmmakers go squarely for Live Action adaptations again often playing it safe to try and appeal to the largest market demographics possible Tom Holland makes for a great Spider-Man but is a appearances feel less fresh and inspired point is it's rare for filmmakers to pay homage to Comic Source material usually because they are not coming from a space of love and immersion in that medium and it's normally only stories that are lifted not aesthetic Styles in this instance the spider-verse references to comic books have become a method of abstract storytelling that their animators are able to take advantage of and really work into a fluid and dynamic piece of art and this keeps audiences invested via fresh visual language perhaps the only criticism that can be leveled towards the latest spider-verse film is that it's being cut into two halves and cynically speaking this may be done to generate more revenue from fans call me old-fashioned but I like it when movies you know end however they got damn lucky the first half is such a good movie because after I saw it I wanted more and not just because it ended on a massive Cliffhanger this bridge between comic and film was once assured to be impossible but here we are and screenwriters Phil Lord and Christopher Miller responsible for hits like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and The Lego Movie have absolutely blown the doors open between the two mediums they've managed to produce and write a compelling story accompanied by incredible voice acting mind-bending Aesthetics and perfect comedic timing all components desperately required to pull off major inspiration for meme creators of course across the spider-verse is fully aware of the effect it has on the internet one of the biggest and most aesthetic moments is the reference to the classic Spider-Man pointing to himself memes which takes place with every single Spider-Man in the Multiverse pointing at each other at exactly the same time it marks a fantastic mind-boggling moment in the film to demonstrate the pure scale of the space its characters inhabit and for that alone it's worth watching this movie in cinemas and don't just take it from me that Spider-Man is a perfect candidate for z mean culture academic interest in this hero consistently backs this idea up with the article on Comics narratives and transmitter multiverses re-envisioning the wall crawler in Spider-Man into the spider-verse the authors note that Spider-Man has become a transmedia piece between film and digital culture asserting worldwide Spectators wait in their seats for the after credit scene of the latest superhero production to be shown a meme turned into an animated transmedia piece from the future how dare you point at me you were pointing first rude to point you're being very rude 20 years ago this would certainly not be a possibility within the world of Cinema it was extremely rare for the internet to have such a large influence on pop culture that it would change the manner in which new characters were announced but Spider-Man has undeniably become intertwined with memes academic interest aside there's more to these films than just audience corroboration one of the biggest themes surrounding the Spider-Man stories is that the main character never seems to fit in you are a freak he's always a bit of a nerd and despite all his efforts to help people he is always accosted by villains who hate him or The Daily Bugle consistently publishing stories about him being Enemy Number one point is Spider-Man is often a social outcast which is absolutely a feeling a lot of people online can relate to not to mention any teenager in general is going to feel like they don't fit in at some point as they try to figure themselves out and watching the spider-verse films are in miles is always told he doesn't belong somewhere whether that be it an elite school or within a group of Spider-Man who are exactly like him is a fantastic way for audiences to become invested in this story as he learns to be himself and just keep going Spider-Man is one of the most popular heroes in the world for good reason he struggles with relationships he has gone through momentous trauma and great at a young age and he always strives to help others even when they treat him like garbage that's an ideal anyone can look up to as he embodies complex feelings and processes highly relatable to children and adults ultimately these movies are tackling human relationships and what it means to lose or create them making for a good story even without all the Fantastical stick which again makes them brilliant candidates for main culture assimilation plus the spider-verse films clearly set off a wave of Multiverse content considering how popular the idea is leading to Multiverse becoming something of a genre from the mid-2010s to 2020s in the film industry although of course it already was so in books Comics TV shows and video games beforehand it's just that right now Multiverse has become more of a mainstream concept this effect could not be more personified by the release of no way home wherein screenwriters Eric Summers and Chris McKenna directly confirmed this fact by pulling in Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield to link up with Tom Holland as well as previous villains played by Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina tapping into the live-action spider-verse this live-action iteration also notably took on the pointing Spider-Man meme perhaps foreshadowing the fact that massive studios are now willing to publicly recognize the effect Ming culture has had on prolonging the shelf life of their films it's also worth mentioning across the spider-verse takes the relatability factor to Spider-Man and turns it up to 11 through the utilization of the Multiverse it's not just a vehicle to show cool heroes in different dimensions doing awesome it's also a way for viewers to insert themselves in the story spider Gwen becomes an insert for girls pavito prabhakarov becomes a self-inser for those living in India and so on the potential is endless for international appeal with this story in short spider-verse films have become gigantic meme factories churning out inspiration for artists at blinding speed as the weeks after the latest film's release have become a free-for-all for unending references and audience participation in the form of artistic callbacks naturally the first spider-verse film won an Oscar for best animated feature in 2019 cementing it as both a critically acclaimed peace and Fan Favorite and I wouldn't be surprised if across the spider-verse were to receive the same honor what meme would you guys like me to give a lesson in next let me know in the comments below I remember [Laughter] or else

Synopsis:
Violent misfortunes frequently occur around 16-year-old Yuuta Okkotsu, a timid victim of high school bullying. Yuuta is saddled with a monstrous curse, a power that dishes out brutal revenge against his bullies. Rika Orimoto, Yuuta's curse, is a shadow from his tragic childhood and a potentially lethal threat to anyone who dares wrong him.

Yuuta's unique situation catches the attention of Satoru Gojou, a powerful sorcerer who teaches at Tokyo Jujutsu High. Gojou sees immense potential in Yuuta, and he hopes to help the boy channel his deadly burden into a force for good. Yet Yuuta struggles to find his place among his talented classmates: the selectively mute Toge Inumaki, weapons expert Maki Zenin, and Panda.

Yuuta clumsily utilizes Rika on missions with the other first-year students, but the grisly aftermath of Rika's tremendous displays of power draws the interest of the calculating curse user Suguru Getou. As Getou strives to claim Rika's strength and use it to eliminate all non-jujutsu users from the world, Yuuta fights alongside his friends to stop the genocidal plot.

Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Movie covers manga chapters 0.1-0.4.

41,zbh79fTG9LA,2023-08-14T00:16:02Z,How to Actually Write a Speedster,"The Final Speedster Episode. This is the last one guys. Its been fun but I truly do not care about speedster logic that much. Or most super hero logic. Infinity war features doctor strange who should have been able to freeze time, cut thanos' arms off with his portals, and win. But he didn't. And I still like infinity war. 6-7/10 for sure. Its obviously a dumb moment when something dumb happens but its not as bad as character assasination or boring ahh writing. So yeah. I've never lowered a score based on a bad logic moment is what im saying. Although it is annoying and objectively embarrassing. Dudes defending it are usually wrong. 

But yeah some dude told me to not be so hard on people who deny basic logic. Because aparently they were my audience. And no. They are not. But also i can't be too sure on these new views. I love you guys but i don't really know how I can please you. I don't wanna make more speedster videos. Not because i burnt out but because theres not much more for me to say. If you wanna see breakdowns on other speedsters you can watch madvocate. Because he deserves it. He basically came up with this and he's the one who does it. Plus since logic is mostly objective what would I be adding? But yeah my orignal video was supposed to be good but i didn't expect it to get views. 

But yeah i love you guys and we'll see what happens.",so after two 10 plus minute videos about why speedsters lose to bad writing I thought it would be a good time to conclude this Saga by talking about how to actually write a Speedster now I did talk about this a few times throughout the videos and basically the reason so many speedsters lose to bad writing is because the writing itself isn't aware of its own implications so many speedsters are either shown or told to be able to basically slow down time and move normally within that perception but then they lose in ways that directly contradict what they either showed or told us in the 1900s when superheroes that we know and love were first being introduced The Flash was the very first Speedster but then you look at his place in the Justice League and he's just kind of a side character not really the focus of the team and that's fair why would he be he's not Superman he's just the guy who runs fast but as the writers kept taking his powers further and further the side character precedent remained and carried over to the flash knockoffs so these days speedsters are very powerful when you think about it but are still treated like normal ass Heroes I'm sure that's what red Rush told Olga hey he could run fast okay it's not exactly one of your Premier super powers so you see this Dynamic where the writers almost try to play Both Sides by being like yeah this is what it looks like to be a Speedster don't sleep on this guy he's a badass but then later treat him like they would any other hero so to put it simply the right way to write a Speedster is to pick a side either just make him a guy who runs fast or treat him as powerful as they are and thankfully I do have an example for both options so because pretty much all the speedsters I talked about are God's created like level one bums let's first talk about a god written like a god [Music] all right please let's have a little respect for public transportation the first thing this movie does is tell us that Megamind never beat Metro man but then you have to think wait how does he get caught by Megamind in these pictures Well Megamind is never shown to be a blood-hungry villain he kind of just wants to beat Metro man even when he takes over the city he doesn't start building concentration camps he kind of just messes around and gets bored and what do we see in one of the greatest character introduction scenes of all time well before I tell you I think this is the right time to say that despite my two very popular videos talking about plot inconsistencies I honestly don't give a  now it is objectively embarrassing when writers can't even follow their own rules but actually following them really isn't deserving of Praise but character writing this seamless this compact this thematically Rich this is what I love and at the end of every day well I often ask myself who would I be about you I love you and I love you random citizen it sounds like he says the line to the audience but he was really talking to himself and that little pause with him thinking to himself like what a scene dude Jesus Christ I also love the parallel with Megamind about struggling to find meaning in their lives but anyway this is probably why metroman has been caught against Megamind because he was probably just toying around especially when we get to see his speed and like oh my god dude this is probably the fastest Speedster ever he contemplates his life while traveling throughout the entire city and we know he did this in like a nanosecond and we don't even know for how long he was in Super Speed judging about how much thinking he did going from trying to clear his mind to faking his own death is it fair to say like five hours maybe six Metro man is written from an angle where he is a God and he's too powerful to be beaten so his conflict doesn't come from beating Megamind it comes from living life with no real journey her goal that's why he chooses to master the guitar and become a full-time gamer Megamind is a great movie and Metro manages the product of great writing people say that if the writers were to treat the spacer like a God then the stories would be boring and meaningless and this couldn't be further from the truth maybe instead of trying to mold and force a Speedster into a role of some normal ass hero with normal ass villains explore the concepts that go in line with their abilities Metro man is proof of this old Superman stories used to explore these topics one punch man is a show that I've never watched but I'm pretty sure that's what it's about and a lot of people like it so there you go imagine if the flash wasn't a show about him having to overcome every random ass villain of the week and instead a show where he absolutely dunks on these metahumans to the point where he becomes cocky and arrogant and then reverse flash sees that Barry doesn't want to train to get faster because he thinks he's unstoppable that's when he brings out the yellow suit to scare Barry into training cut it down from like 16 hours to a good eight hours in there I think that would have been a good show now some people's reaction to this might be oh my god dude why do you have to ruin our fun like why does flesh have to be a God and to that I say how about we don't have time Travel how about we don't freeze time how about we drop speed of light and fade amazing and lightning bolts and speed force how about just a good 200 miles per hour how about Dash now I already talked about Dash in my last video but basically the reason he's so important is because he's exactly what most speedsters are supposed to be they can move fast and yeah they look like a nightmare to deal with but you can still catch them with timing or misdirection this is how I believe most Speedster should be written because then they really can be sidekick superheroes and you can also have villains like Captain cold but like I said in the video most writers also want to show these slow motion scenes to be like oh my god look how cool he is super speed is awesome but then shortly after contradict themselves anyway redrush is honestly my main example of this and I want to say that I don't really like invincible and no it's not because redriffs died in a way it's because most of the dialogue is too upfront with obvious meaning and the plot lines are very generic Welcome To Mars Earth and the reason I bring this up is because of the writing in this red Rush scene by this point it's clear that the writers want to characterize The Gardens of the globe and convince you that they'll be the main character so it's more shocking when omniman kills them all so obviously red Rush was going to get a scene with his girlfriend so yeah the writers here are like yeah let's make people think about what it is to be a Speedster and this scene not only introduces but explores the fact that redress perceives time in slow motion and before this in the electro scene you could have honestly had me believe that red wish was just a dash type guy who moves out like 100 miles per hour instead of the writers using the scene to explore red Rush as a person we just get this somewhat compelling conflict that honestly doesn't even make any sense like why does it imply that red Rush is always in speed react mode just like I said before did he actually get good at talking super slowly so it would sound normal so ultimately guys the key to writing a Speedster is basic logic write them to the level of their abilities and this isn't skill any writer with the brain could do this which is why my enjoyment of something doesn't come from the plot in its consistency but instead from the Artistry lying beneath [Music]

Better Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White's lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is ""fixer"" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts ""criminal"" in ""criminal lawyer.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt, based on video game designer Mike Pondsmith's game series. Set in a dystopian Cyberpunk universe, the player assumes the role of ""V"" (played by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary in the fictional Californian city known as ""Night City"", where they deal with the fallout from a heist gone wrong that results in an experimental cybernetic ""bio-chip"" containing an engram of the legendary rock star and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) threatening to slowly overwrite V's mind; as the story progresses V and Johnny must work together to find a way to be separated and save V's life.

The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016). The game was developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves had a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin Przybyłowicz, and featured the contributions of several licensed artists. After years of anticipation, CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.

Cyberpunk 2077 received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics. However, some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism. It was also widely criticized for bugs, particularly in the console versions which suffered from performance problems. Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems. CD Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85 million. By September 2022, the game has sold more than 20 million copies. An expansion, Phantom Liberty, is set to release on 26 September 2023 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A sequel was announced.

#cyberpunk2077 #gaming #ps5 #xbox",well everybody the day is finally here where we can play cyberpunk 2077 2.0 it's a lot of numbers this is the latest version of the game that is totally reworked has all sorts of crazy new tech that we're gonna go through in addition to totally reworked mechanics perk systems gun play driving mechanics all of it totally totally revamped and reworked in my opinion in much much better ways first things first there is a murder scene they found somebody in a dumpster that's unfortunate we're just gonna keep going on our merry way though you know what let's talk about the elephant very much in the room and that is how crazy gorgeous this game is right now in my opinion which is subjective of course this has got to be one of if not the best looking game in existence right now like it's that crazy what they're doing here part of the reason it looks so good in a situation like this especially even with like Ray Trace to reflect sections and everything that directly mirror what can be seen with the naked eye I mean it's just wild how well done it is but the reason it looks that good is because we're actually playing with full Ray tracing but not just full Ray tracing path tracing enabled in the graphics menu you'll see it as an option up here in the plane defaults it's the one all the way over to the right and what this does is that it cranks everything down here including path tracing which is considered a technology preview it's not even considered like expected you're going to do this while you play and path tracing in photo mode which of course as you would expect gives you path tracing in photo mode but perhaps the craziest thing that they're able to do here is what's called dlss Ray reconstruction and this is something brand new to dlss 3.5 which as far as I'm aware cyberpunk 2077 2.0 is the first time it's been used in a game maybe I'm wrong but it's the first time I'm aware of it but basically what it does is it will go and actually reuse rays that have been traced in previous frames which gives you greatly improved performance in addition to two improved Ray traced lighting that's much more organic and feels natural to Showcase it let's go to night time here I'm just gonna skip time we're gonna go all the way to the middle of the night just to see what this is like in action okay Boop nighttime midnight here we go so now you can see everything Ray traced very very precisely all of this lighting is reflecting realistically off the concrete all of those neon lights are reflecting realistically the wet ground is reflecting everything we can see I mean it's all just crazy crazy gorgeous and if I just stand still and we'll cycle this to low settings just to show you the before and after here's what it looks like on low versus the overdrive so that's the first thing that's why the game looks so freaking ridiculously good everywhere you look is because it's a technological Masterpiece as far as I can tell it's hilarious that the game started so broken now it's like basically a game that's also a tech demo for NVIDIA it's wild but you know what that's just that's how cdpr rolls apparently but let's look at some of the other stuff that they've changed this save file is only about nine hours into the game because I can't show you anything with the new Phantom Liberty DLC so we're only about nine hours in during this save but even if you pop into a save you've already had and you don't start from scratch you'll be prompted with this little thing right here character reset due to significant changes in gameplay mechanics your perks have been reset and your perk points have been refunded allowing you to rebuild your character however you like and then you can go in here you can see you can reapply everything and if you want to reset your attribute points as well you get one free reset of that as well to set everything to three so that you can then build your character exactly as you want them once we actually pop into the skill trees you can see it's all brand new totally redesigned each of these are kind of gated by what level you need in that attribute so if you want to level up this skill the focus skill you actually have to have nine in your cool stat and if you want to play with these you have to get to 15. and if you want these max level perks as well you have to as you would expect max level the attribute in question in this case let's just fully level our body and just be like a total gorilla just smacking everything to get our way and maybe a little cool just a little just a tad and then we can go in here and we can really tweak it as we want this right here is a perkability I actually think is a little bit broken basically it gives you health regen depending on what you're doing so in this case it lets you mitigate damage it lets you also get an improved Health Region as you're missing more of it it'll also regen your health in combat while you're sprinting or also just for each nearby enemy it'll give you a multiplier honestly it kind of makes the game feel like it's an easy mode but um it's fun and it lets you go really crazy and for a melee build I think it's pretty important and here we go hit it up just like this we're all out of perk points and everything and we're very specialized ready to go now one of the other things they've totally revamped is the police system so let's test it out and see just how it's changed I'm sorry everybody the only way to do this is to make a Ruckus with a police officer nearby I'm sorry whoosh whoosh I just have a gigantic Hammer hey dude yeah it's me I'm the one with a hammer smacking people whack [Music] whack hey dude uh whack quack yeah bring your friends bring your friends and here they come so they drive up now it's not weird drones they actually drive up that's cool to see and you'll see also next to the map there's those two little stars as we do more damage and as we piss them off more and more that's only going to increase this is what's been referred to as like a GTA style police system where the more pissed off they get the bigger the response now we're up to three stars we're on our way boyakasha I just Chuck a bunch of grenades maybe I can rile them up we never gonna die I'm shocked they're just so freely firing into their friends but now you see it's getting much more difficult so I'm gonna get in and I'm gonna start fleeing okay we also have vehicle combat now and I can shoot even while driving the car and now they're gonna start chasing me again totally different than how it was before before the police were like laughably stupid and the response was super uncoordinated but now it feels relatively realistic especially compared to what we had before like good luck they're oh wow right as I'm like wow it's more realistic they drive head first into a concrete pillar and explode oops okay I'm trying to get away no leave me alone now we're at four stars oh geez you know what happens when we get to five we're gonna find out oh they're very mad they're very very very mad at me I can't blame them now it's like gang members are pissed off too everybody run we're gonna see if we can get to Five Stars I don't know if we can I don't know it's pretty tough to get there oh they're trying to Ram me they have a blockade to drive around it dude I ain't going now without a fight oh baby I don't know how I blew that up oh god oh this car is not long for this world I don't know if we're gonna be able to do it they're so angry I'm gonna try to take their car take the big car the big armored car hey we did it okay we might actually make it now if this hasn't gotten them to the point where they call in the National Guard like what will like I'm just rampaging through the city streets they can't stop me and I'm not even at five stars yet this car we're gonna take the fast car I want this Oh Lordy there they come okay we're gonna keep going keep going never give up never give up change the world make your dreams come true hey Mr Scott what you gonna do what you gonna do make your dreams come true let's get it I how am I still not at five stars I don't even know man what would I have to do to get to Five Stars oh they have one of the cars with machine guns oh they all do oh God oh no go don't give up don't give up it's okay oh wow yeah so some cars now have machine guns built in and they're very powerful um let's get this thing this thing no that looks terrible oh my God I'm just gonna take this weaponized vehicle okay now I can show you look at this I can just like unload or I can swap to weapons or missiles and I can just go launching isn't that crazy Isn't that cool oh we made it to five we made it to five Max Tech is in route baby you have to earn this you have to earn five stars they do not just give it to you oh baby okay Max attack is on its way we are totally screwed we are totally totally screwed and I've never been so happy about it oh breach imminent I'm a confirmed cyber psycho I did it here they are here they are they came hey babies oh oh they hurt oh God oh no wow dude they don't mess around oh my goodness wow that was crazy so I guess all that to say the new police system is fun I didn't mean to uh get so distracted by that I was kind of like oh we'll quickly get to five stars and then we'll move on with the rest of the video but I just spent like 10 minutes trying to get to five stars and slowly and surely pissing off an entire nation basically uh but you know what we made it we're okay now oh so you might notice one little thing changed so the stamina bar has also been totally reworked now instead of like taking charge when you're sprinting and moving how it's going to take and reduce its charge is based on firing so as you fire you see that yellow bar in the top left drops and how it will reflect when you're actually firing like an assault rifle or an lmg or something is that as that gets depleted your shots become more unstable and the spread gets wider it's simulating effectively like the longer you hold that position the weaker you get so it starts to wiggle and you become less accurate it's an interesting change and I actually like it a good amount um I wasn't sure about it when I heard about it but I actually think it strikes a really good balance and plays well now one of the other things they've changed and tweaked is how Ripper docs work and how armor works as well it used to be that all of your armor stats and everything was tied up in the equipment you were wearing which is why everybody ended up looking totally Ridiculous by the time you were done playing the game however now that's all been changed and it's all tied into your cybernetics and augmentations so this is what the new cyberware screen looks like and as you can see it's all based on total cyberware capacity as you would expect and then each of these has a cost for cyberware so some of them are more demanding on your system than others as you would once again expect but in the integumentary system as you can see down here this subdermal armor has an armor score of 25 with plus two to health and you can actually level up using these crafting components which have been reworked as well and then it becomes 28 and then you could level it up again if you had enough materials and see it improved even further and I think this system works way way better than the clothing-based system they had before in addition they they have greatly reduced the costs associated with each of these upgrades meaning that they're much more accessible and this was one of my biggest frustrations with cyberpunk 2077 at launch was that it's all about cyberware it's all about having these crazy augmentations and yet they were so expensive in the base game when it launched that basically nobody could enjoy them or see them I think it makes sense to have like legendary status or iconic status tier V items and augmentations be 38 000 Eddies but when everything even the starter augmentations were that expensive it just didn't make any sense people would get one or two in the entire run time of the game and miss out on some of the coolest stuff that cyberpunk 2077 had to offer and so they've adjusted all that pricing now is much much more reasonable and because all these systems like armor and everything else is tied into it you have a reason to engage with it very very frequently and you will see when you boot the game up for yourself and start a fresh run through you're going to be spending a lot more time at the Ripper dock than you would have expected and they also updated the game since launch to allow you to change your appearance entirely which I'm very happy about because on this save that we loaded into from back in like 2021 in January of 2021 I believe this version of V was very very um red and in the Character Creator screen I didn't think she looked this red but in the game she looks like some weird ghoul so I can actually just change that now whereas in the base game before I couldn't you were just stuck with whatever you did which didn't make any damn sense on the lore or the setting but now you can actually change your appearance as much or as little as you want to green hair let's do it an eye color we can change that out let's go green eyes as well just look totally demented I love it AI behaviors have been improved as well City density has been improved everybody seems to be behaving much more naturalistically and that might just be like a weird bias or that I'm looking for it now but before you'd end up with NPCs just walking face first into each other for an extended period of time and now it seems like that has largely been mitigated it really does seem that they've done a lot of work to make 2.0 the definitive version of cyberpunk 2077 and in a lot of ways it feels like what the game was supposed to be from the start and frankly if the game launched in this state with these systems as they are now and let's just say it released today on the 21st of September 2023 I I would have no doubt that it would be a contender for game of the year it finally is where it needed to be back then and while that doesn't forgive the god-awful launch and this really frankly scummy things that they did to hide the state of the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game for example from their consumers I think this is a great step forward towards healing that because they could have just moved on abandoned the game and moved on to the Witcher 4 or whatever they end up doing next but instead they stuck with it they fixed it gave us an amazing update that adds so much and fundamentally changes how the game plays in a very good way and paired it with a DLC expansion that is phenomenal taboo which I'll be talking about more on the 26th when it launches because then I can publish my review with all my footage and everything so I'll post my full review then when I say that every element of cyberpunk is approved I really mean it like even down to the loot on random bodies you'll find has been streamlined and made more efficient and effective like instead of random junk being scattered in this guy's inventory we now have tier three item components that we need for crafting and upgrading stuff and we also have ammo and Eddies like exactly what you would expect and hope to find and it makes looting actually worthwhile whereas before it was always like okay gotta sift carefully through a bunch of garbage and it's just great to see it's great to see a game make somewhat of a comeback and actually perform the way that frankly it should have all along but you know what better late than never I suppose and the operative question has been since this was announced whether you should go and start a brand new game or if you should just load into a save you already had and then respect like I just did here and go on from there and frankly I would recommend starting from scratch I think that's the best way to do that I've done that on another character that again I can't show you because it's in the DLC so that would technically break NDA so I would just leave you with this it is a totally new game now it plays like a new game it feels in a lot of ways almost like a sequel bizarrely enough and it's just so good so good to see cdpr back at the top of their game it's just wonderful to see and frankly this is the end cap on all of it 2.0 really is the crowning achievement of cyberpunk 2077 it's finally the game game we all hoped it would be three years ago uh but you know what it's here now and they're sending it through a free update instead of just like waiting to do all these fixes in a sequel which let's be honest a lot of other Studios and devs would have done so I'll give them credit where credit is due it's great to see them fix it finally and if you are interested it launches like now so when you're seeing this video it's out you have to be on PS5 or Xbox series consoles or PC to enjoy the 2.0 update because last gen consoles just simply can't handle it but so long as you meet those criteria and you own cyberpunk you can download it for free and enjoy a totally new experience and I recommend that you do but that's gonna do it for me I'm gonna keep working my way through cyberpunk 2077 again enjoying these city streets once more and I'll see you in the next one thanks for watching much love you make my dreams a reality every single day that I can do this for a living I can get a house for me my wife and my two little boys and provide for them while playing and talking about video games for a living it's wild to me and I owe it all to you so truly truly thank you with all that said enough mushy gushy stuff much love I'll see in the next one hugs and kisses bye-bye

Doctor Strange recently appeared in Spider-Man: No Way Home to cast a very important spell. And, pretty soon we can look forward to seeing his sequel, in the Multiverse of Madness. But you should really revisit the first film, because it is criminally underrated. The film is a masterpiece of visuals, character drama, and hidden symbolism. And it deserves its place among Marvel's best.

#DrStrange #VideoEssay",we don't get to choose our time death is what gives life meaning to know your days are numbered your time is short welcome back screen crush i'm ryan airy doctor strange has become a major player in the mcu but it seems like his 2016 solo movie is ancient history no one's hailed doctor strange as the best mcu film ever and in truth it isn't but when the film came out the overall reaction to the movie was pretty positive and it did really well at the box office and yet five years later the film's stunning visuals receive praise but the movie itself is remembered as generic and nothing too special sometimes ranked among the worst mcu movies i don't think this movie is being appreciated the way it should be it has its faults but it's a unique fascinating origin story with outstanding visuals creative action and a powerful message about life and purpose and so allow me to dive deep into doctor strange and explained why this movie is so underrated and possibly convince fans to give this one another chance go mamu i've come to bargain but first let's talk about some of the reasons why doctor strange might feel generic and unfavorable now while underrated the movie does have undeniable glaring problems a lackluster villain underdeveloped supporting characters some poorly timed jokes and the all too familiar mcu tropes that at times feel detrimental to movies that are trying to be different try me beyonce come on you've heard of her she's a huge star right the pacing of this film can also be a bit problematic the first hour's exposition feels a bit sluggish while the second half is rushed as the movie races from one action scene to the other giving us very little time to breathe and take in the major revelations and implications of these characters and i think most of these problems are due to the film's timid run time which is just barely two hours long making it almost impossible to truly develop the film's dense themes and complex characters so ultimately the film's biggest enemy is time which is fitting considering the movie's focus on time also the folks in carmartage just suck at security like anyone can walk into the library and steal super dangerous books and infinity stones i am now the guardian of these books so if a volume from this collection should be stolen again i'd know it five minutes later a few moments later pack your things get out of my building you're fired there are also the obvious similarities between strange and iron man especially their origin stories also dr strange came out in a jam-packed year for superhero movies being lost in between all the heavy hitters and it was around the time that people started to complain about superhero fatigue so i think doctor strange fell short of standing out as a truly special film in the eyes of the audience and as a result it was misremembered as a bad movie now of course it's all subjective so with all that said let's talk about the greatness of doctor strange open your eye so we will dive into all the amazing visuals the creative action and that perfect climax and i might even prove to you that kaiselius wasn't such a terrible villain that's impossible but first i want to start with the most underrated scene in this underrated movie i'm talking about the surgery scene early in the film on paper this scene isn't really anything special compared to all the other awesome moments that we get later on but this scene perfectly establishes the movie's main theme time as strange begins the surgery he's distracted by the ticking sounds of dr west's watch dr west cover your watch now on the surface you can interpret this as nothing more than the annoying taking sound distracting strange now just listen to the music and sounds during the scene from this moment all the sounds in the music in the background are all ticking dr west what are you doing rising in their intensity symbolizing the race against time to save this man's life [Music] once strange begins the most complex part of the surgery all the sounds disappear [Music] all but the ticking sound of the watch [Music] a reminder that time is always there dr west cover your watch so when the watch is covered we are left with a consistent melody [Music] if time stops for steven then it's no longer a factor that can distract him it's as if he takes control over time performing miracles with his hands [Music] it also foreshadows the way he defeats dormammu this is great sound editing something that rarely plays a big role in the mcu but this also ties into the movie's exploration of time and life the true meaning of this scene isn't about freezing time but it's about the precious moments of our lives time can become relative if we focus on enjoying each moment prolonging time in our minds as a surgeon dr strange assumes a type of control over time being able to use his skills to prolong a patient's life as if he's alluding time itself and yet time comes for us all we don't get to choose our time death is what gives life meaning to know your days are numbered your time is short you'd think after all this time might be ready but look at me stretching one moment out into a thousand that's really powerful every mortal being races against time we can never catch up yet we still try we feel it spill out of our hands like sand aware that time is the end of us as we grow older we move closer and closer to our tragic finality all things age all things die time is the true enemy of us all time kills everything but it doesn't have to be so depressing not if we accept that time is just part of our natural journey and allow ourselves to forget about our endless race against time a race that we simply can't win because we're not meant to and that's okay our limited time on this earth gives us the motivation to push forward not waste away live our lives find purpose find happiness and maybe do some good from time to time but a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts i want to take a second to talk about mental health now i have gone through some really dark times in my life and i'm grateful that i had therapy to help me through them therapy can feel daunting if you've never done it before how do you find a therapist what kind should you see or maybe you live in a remote area like i used to well cerebral can help you they're the sponsor of this video cerebral is a mental health platform that gives you access to online prescription medication management counseling and therapy cerebral can help you treat a variety of

mental health click the link in the description to start the questionnaire and get connected with the provider right away your first month starts at only thirty dollars people think in terms of good and evil when really time is the true enemy of us all time kills everything time obviously plays a crucial role in doctor strange but i think that this missable scene provides us with the dense and beautiful meaning behind this movie and all of this is told to us with visuals and sound not much talking no info dump or exposition something that makes this scene feel even more unique and clever okay so i could go on about this scene but there are also so many other goodies in doctor strange and one of my other favorite things about this movie are the astonishing visuals who are you in this vast multiverse they are mesmerizing not just beautiful eye candy there's creativity to all of it the vfx have a crucial role they serve the visual atmosphere they are grand enhancing the story without feeling overbearing my heart still pounds every time the ancient one sends steven through the multiverse what words can i use to explain the beauty that's on screen right now perfection it's as if space odyssey and inception took lsd and made a baby a beautiful high little baby and the colors oh the colors this movie is filled with vibrant tones this is hands down one of the most beautiful mcu movies ever made and these visuals go hand in hand with the creative action scenes seriously all of these action scenes are so unique and different each set piece has its own special rules and mechanics the film takes a lot of inspiration from inception and the matrix and of course there's the time reverse battle that did tenant before nolan yes nolan and the wachowskis did it better but that's a really high bar but these ever changing environments and rules aren't just there to copy other films they're always connected directly to the action on screen they are unique and iconic and unlike anything else in the mcu i also love the magic system how it's explained and the mechanics of it all it also looks freaking amazing i love the fire effect on the spells and the portals you can't just wave your hands and shout silly words expelliarmus this takes skill practice and understanding even the exposition works here because it gives us a mostly logical explanation on how magic works now usually i don't need explanations for my magic systems but our main character is a man of science a surgeon so you need a more technical approach to this how did you get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone study and practice years of it also the cast is stellar especially benedict cumberbatch he does not get enough credit for his role he totally nails the personality of doctor strange but most fans will praise these things but the themes that are under the surface get much less recognition like the powerful origin story on the surface strange's origins feel familiar but not if you look closer tony stark also started out as an a-hole but he was a very likable a-hole and he began his redemption arc as soon as he came out of the cave strange is not meant to be a likable a-hole no he's an overbearing arrogant know-it-all selfish control freak oh you think you see through me do you well you don't just look at this scene where strange can't even embrace this woman a loved one of the man whose life he just saved he can't show her empathy because at some point he stopped seeing his patients as people they became trophies achievements to his perfect record as the world's best neurosurgeon that's the only way he can justify turning away patients that he considers to be lost causes i have a 68 year old female with an advanced brain stem glioma yeah you want me to screw up my perfect record definitely not they're a risk if he can't save them then that means he's failed and strange cannot fail you want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything even death which no one can control not even the great doctor stephen strange this is why he's obsessed with winning and throwing these victories in everyone's faces all the time when stephen is injured we understand why losing his hands is such a devastating blow but it's more than desperation it's a loss of purpose and the whole thing is presented in a very realistic way the injury isn't some miraculous accident that gives stephen powers it's grounded and gruesome which makes it so much more powerful and relatable how many of us spend our entire lives searching for purpose how many of us actually managed to find it strange had a purpose he was the best at what he did he was fulfilled in his own selfish way without his hands he has no purpose and without purpose life becomes an empty existence and because strange is a control freak he falls into chronic depression he begins to self-destruct and hurts the people he loves life without my work is still life this isn't the end there are other things that can give your life meaning like wife like you and side note the arguments between stephen and christine felt like some of the most real couple fights in the mcu it was ugly but it's a good reflection of how bad things get between people when they deal with depression and pain and that makes strange's story different from most other heroes because how many mcu heroes actually dealt with depression stephen strange is a junkie and he's hooked on control even when he's learning about the mystic arts he can't let go of control he must win so he's terrified of failing and embracing his flaws so he's incapable of taking a true risk even if it means he could gain the power to fix his hands you cannot beat a river into submission you have to surrender to its current and use its power as your own i i control it by surrendering control that doesn't make any sense it's only after being forced to take the risk and fight for his survival that steven can begin to change now some critics say that strange learned magic too fast but he's a self-made man who achieved his greatness with dedication and a lot of hard work so once he was able to overcome his mental barriers learning magic became like second nature but strange doesn't become a hero after learning magic he's at carmartage only for himself only to fix his hands that's why he breaks the rules and doesn't care about the consequences when he uses dangerous spells in the time stone in his mind it's still all about him he has no interest in becoming a hero and most of his heroics in the movie are just thrust upon him steven's entire arc culminates in one perfect moment arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all which is it's not about you it's not about him it's about the people he saved could have saved will save as the most skillful neurosurgeon stephen could have done so much good save so many people change the world even but his obsessive personality prevented him from being a truly great man or a great doctor and as a master of the mystic arts he can make a purely selfless choice amend his past and save all of reality and what i love most about this arc is that the movie takes its time getting to this point strange needed to first face and accept his flaws he had to understand what prevented him from changing only then was he able to find his new purpose but understanding is one thing actually making the choice is what allows people to truly change now he could use his newfound abilities to fix his hands and go back to his previous life leaving behind all the magic and hero stuff the old strange would have left in a heartbeat so i could have my hands back again my old life or he can embrace his change understand that he can become something new a man reborn free to choose a new purpose or to serve something greater than himself and he chooses to give up control and believe in a cause greater than himself he chooses to help the world as the healer that he was meant to be not as a surgeon but as the sorcerer supreme you said that losing my hands didn't have to be the end that it could be a beginning also can we talk about how beautiful this scene is not just visually but the words that are said but look at me stretching one moment out into a thousand just so that i can watch the snow this scene encompasses the film's main theme time also i just love the final showdown when strange comes to bargain with dormammu for mamu i've come to bargain this is one of the few mcu fights where the hero wins by outsmarting his enemy no punching no magic hammers or cosmic fists just his brain power it's refreshing it's creative and it's so smart and this is who strange is he's a neurosurgeon and this is cosmic scale surgery i love that marvel did this instead of trying to make this just another epic cgi battle strange knows that he can't defeat dormammu with brute force so he finds a clever solution using his brilliance and the tools at his disposal he understands how the time stone works he figures out dormammu's weakness so he finds a way to outsmart the villain with surgical precision it's pure problem-solving and requires self-sacrifice you and me trapped in this moment endlessly yes but everyone on earth will live this climax is the culmination of everything strange has gone through and his newfound understanding of himself strange is willing to die over and over again because it's the only way to keep his patients alive to save the world from dormammu it's not about him or his pain and it's certainly not about winning it's about the people he's saving you will never win but i could lose again and again now let's talk about kaiselius and see if he was really such a terrible villain after all now he's not the best villain but he's far from terrible mads mikkelsen's performance really saves this character kaiselius calls time the enemy of all life and the only way to escape the control of time is dormammu's dark dimension a reality outside of time there's mordechai cilius if you look closely enough his motivations might not be that fleshed out but i think that the minimalistic exposition works when kaiselius explains his motivations i think you mostly get it if you really listen and watch mads mickelson's eyes fall well beyond time because time is what enslaves this time it's an insult death is an insult that makeup and the glossy eyes do the trick but couple it with this when he first came to us he'd lost everyone he ever loved he was a grieving broken man searching for answers in the mystic arts and i think we get everything we need to know about kaiselius he lost everything everyone that's why he's trying to control time attempting to create a world outside of time a place where he won't lose anything anymore it's sad and relatable while a fully realized villain is always better i think that this time this approach works and while i don't think that letting a bean from another dimension consume earth is the best plant in the world i still think that kaiselius really makes some interesting points about life and time and some of it might hit harder after the eternals like this line in the end our sun burns out our universe grows cold and perishes also i like that cassilius breaks bad because he discovers the truth about the ancient one that she draws power from the dark dimension it makes sense because it's what ends up turning mordo as well they both believed in the ancient one but because they didn't have anything else they became dependent on their leader almost like joining a cult so you joined a cult no i didn't no not exactly it's not a cult well that's what a cultist would say the revelation about the ancient one makes them see her as a hypocrite and it breaks them all over again i've hated drawing power from the dark dimension but as you well know sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good and that's another thing that i love there's no simple good versus evil here the movie raises some strong questions about existence and when superhero movies do that it always gets a thumbs up from me kaiselius also parallels steven strange when the ancient one kicks steven out she does it because she sees the potential for strange to become another kaiselius they both lost so much they came to her broken with no purpose with barely any life left in them both have similar world views as you can see in these two scenes we are made of matter and nothing more just another tiny momentary spec within an indifferent universe what about the people you killed tiny momentary specs within an indifferent universe strange's reaction to kaiselius's words say it all he realizes that there was a time when he might have shared kaiselius's perspective the show what if actually showed a world where strange lets his pain overcome him corrupt him turn him into the same zealot that gaicilius had become but when he sees his past reflected in kaiselius's words he understands that he has changed he's no longer buried by his own pain and selfishness so while kaiselius doesn't shine as a great villain his role in strange's development is crucial in the end the best antagonist to someone whose existence helps the protagonist to change and evolve and kaiselius does this by serving as a warped mirror image stop also look the cloak of levitation was brilliant they gave an inanimate object a personality you're in that out of that  object so yeah i really like the movie doctor strange is beautiful it might not be the best mcu movie but it's unique and strange it tries to do something different and for the most part it really works and that's why we love it shut me free no i've come to bargain but how do you feel about doctor strange let me know in the comments below or at me on twitter and if it's your first time here please subscribe for

The cat is held by owner.  

The camera is attached to the spinning laundry/dryer machine.

The cat is stationary.

It's movie effects....like Jurassic Park....the dinosaurs were movie props.

Cat was not harmed in this filming.

This is an homage or parody to the movie Interstellar's Endurance docking scene

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",ahsoka's interaction with Anakin might have a closer connection to Padme than you first thought when Ahsoka said she wanted to stop fighting Anakin seem to know and understand what Ahsoka was really going through when Padme gave birth to Luke and Leia she lost the will to live after seeing what Anakin had become in other words she stopped fighting she'd fallen out of love during the flashback to the siege of Mandalore Ahsoka questioned how much of Anakin is within her if his darkness and his dark past are a part of her as much as they are a part of Anakin and as Ahsoka confronted Anakin about his past as Darth Vader he realized that was the main source of ahsoka's lack of motivation to continue mainly because she felt she had to carry a legacy stained with death and destruction Anakin gave her the choice to live and be a force for good in the Galaxy or die letting everything he taught her during their time as master and Apprentice be forgotten and pushed her to learn her final lesson that the Dark Legacy he created is not her responsibility and she is more than the mistakes her master made after Ahsoka said she chose to live Anakin was relieved see he could keep someone he cared about from giving up on Hope

#StarWars #ahsoka",well everyone is excited for the return of Ezra and thraw and seeing them in live action for the first time there's one other thing that I'm actually pretty equally excited for the return of the Chimera when the ship first showed up in Rebels I admittedly wasn't a huge fan of the artwork on the underside but over time I have to say it's really grown on me out of Universe from the point of view of developing the show it makes sense to have something to help the audience know which of the various Star Destroyers is the one with the main villain on it while still letting him keep that ship type and today I started thinking about how cool that's going to look in live action we still don't know what shape Chimera is going to be in after the significant amount of damage done to it in the battle of the fall when the purle were taking it away but honestly seeing that artwork on a ship that's floating there in pieces would probably look even cooler so basically we can't lose

highs there are plenty more lows while shows like the Mandalorian and Andor have their fans shows like Obi-Wan in the book of Boba Fett are the stuff of legend for how bad they are and it looks like

wear the t-shirt and hang out with us all summer long and now back to the video modern Star Wars isn't very good in fact it's terrible outside of a few select episodes of the shows mentioned a moment ago the Star Wars brand keeps sustaining more and more damage the overpriced movies failed to deliver the merchandise from eight years ago still sits on store shelves and the number one emotion associated with the property is apathy however fans are excited about the acolyte because word on the street is it's canceled this comes from giant freaking robot rumors are flying that Star Wars the acolyte has been canceled at Disney plus following the firing of showrunner Leslie Hedland Cosmic Book News made the initial report based on claims that noted leaker Doom with producer Cameron Pasha cited as a source the YouTuber explained that Pasha found from a source at lucasfilm only referred to as sparrow that made a claim about Headlands firing and as a result the upcoming series was given a soft cancellation the most ambitious and mysterious Disney plus series set in the world of Star Wars not much has been known about the acolyte since it was first announced but the cast did include the likes of Carrie Anne Moss Manny Jacinto Lee jong-jae and a mandala Stenberg other than the cast list and general setting of the era of the high Republic a century before The Phantom Menace the studio shared no details on the production and with a potential cancellation it's now clear why Doom Cox Revelations about the firing and soft cancellation matches how Disney and Lucas some have handled the rumors swirling around Ryan Johnson's Star Wars Trilogy with no official news of cancellation which would be emitting fault on some level the company is instead just letting it remain in a state of limbo who effectively cancel as long as there's no official acknowledgment lucasfilm can continually hint at the shows in production and being worked on for as long as they need before the general public forgets about it Star Wars the acolyte is likely to suffer the same fate as it seems the leakers can't even agree on the basic premise of the plot which isn't a reflection of the quality of the information and instead points to turmoil behind the scenes the earliest information pointed towards the series being darker than what fans are used to with the Jedi being painted as bad guys whether that's because the story is from a Sith point of view or playing around with Shades of Gray is unknown and we may never get a satisfying answer at one point the aclight was rumored to follow Jedi Master likely carrion Moss with her Jedi Padawan as they solved heinous crimes in another leak months later it was brought up that stenberg's character would be betrayed by both the Jedi and the Sith causing her to try to destroy the force either way it sounds like a fascinating premise for a Star Wars series especially one not afraid to point out the hypocrisy of the Jedi witness during the prequel trilogy today's rumor appears valid based on the lack of information about the acolyte especially compared to how other in-development movies and shows have been slowly leaking information to the fans the world of Star Wars is a vast and perfect for series to take place in the distant past but fans will have to get their fix from Logan's James Mangold humming a movie set even further back at the dawn of the Jedi Order regardless of what happened behind the scenes of Another Doom Star Wars series don't be surprised if no information about the acolyte ever comes out and Disney stops mentioning it during press conferences while cancellation is almost never good news given how badly bruised the franchise is after the rise of Skywalker failing to put out a substandard show beats the alternative of making fans suffer this rumor comes from the fact that no information about the show is known that is true or was up until today at the second blue dragon series Awards event in itchy in Korea talented actor Lee jong-jae gave us some eagerly awaited confirmation that the Star Wars acolyte wrapped in May as planned and he spoke about his challenges filming the series in English is having a hard time speaking English with something that we suspected after seeing him attend Star Wars celebration with a translator by his side as reported by K bizum the actor confirmed that filming the show in a different language than Korean brought its own set of challenges but he made a point of saying that it was a fun experience overall it was a meaningful experience for me personally I had a hard time because there were so many English lines but it was fun the actor and staff who worked with me helped me out a lot so I finished filming happily I filmed the acolyte until May this year it was all on location filming in London I filmed in Europe and elsewhere it was a meaningful experience for me personally while the main base of operations for the aclight was set up in Sheffield Studios 40 miles west of London we knew that because the crew visited the Madeira Islands in Portugal for a few days in March the acolyte is set to release in some time in 2024. the show will focus on female villains as it depicts how it was possible for the Sith to rise to such power in the prequel trilogy a teaser trailer was shown at Star Wars celebration attendees back in April though no word yet of winter if that footage will be released to the public the show is expected to last from multiple Seasons so the rumor falls apart since there is news about the show's production timeline it's obvious fans are tired of bad Star Wars content from Disney but as we know lucasfilm doesn't care about the fans the internal workings of lucasfilm aren't fully known but what we do know is that it's run very poorly two weeks ago we discussed a newly published book Burn it Down by Maureen Ryan in it a source discussed how Lucas home was very relaxed with the budgets and how nepotism runs the company lucasfilm hasn't produced consistently successful Star Wars content since being purchased by Disney in 2012. We did an entire video about that book in the internal feathers of lucasfilm so check that out in the title card up above rumors of this sort of thing are nothing new but very little comes to fruition bits and pieces may be accurate over time but like the old adage says a broken clock is right twice a day the real story here isn't the rumor it's the why fans are fed up with lucasfilm for over a decade the company that George lucasfil has produced subpar Star Wars content the films have been disappointing the EU has eliminated fan favorite characters were brushed aside for newer lesser characters that failed to make an impact and a whole lot more added to the fact that lucasfilm keeps doubling down on bad decisions and you start to get a clearer picture of why Star Wars fans aren't Star Wars fans anymore this goes beyond Star Wars the same tactic that ruined Star Wars is ruining the new Indiana Jones film The dial of Destiny is set to disappoint when it drops in just a few days some argue it's premature to say this but every lucasfilm project suffers the same problem every lucasfilm project suffers the same fate and every lucasfilm project causes fans to suffer and the fans are tired of suffering some are hoping for a Batgirl scenario the Batgirl scenario is the studio canceling this show after it's already been produced Batgirl was shot but Warner Brothers decided to use the film as a tax write-off instead of releasing it the history of Star Wars cancellations is much different than that of DC cancellations the Star Wars projects were never far along into production and according to the lead actor a rap filming the entire series last month no matter what the Accolade is gearing up to be another disappointing chapter in the Star Wars saga even the once great Mandalorian has angered audiences bad stories pointless cameos and bad World building that ultimately LED nowhere Star Wars can't win and it's not the fans who are the problem [Music] so folks what do you think about this what do you think of the news what do you think of the rumor I want to know what you think down below here are your three questions one do you believe the rumor that the acolyte will not get released two based on that rumor what do you think about Lee Jong jae's words the lead actor who said the show's been filmed already and three are you interested in the acolyte me personally no everything they say about it sounds less and less appealing it won't be the first Star Wars show that I've skipped outright but it'll just be another one that I skipped because I don't have enough time to watch crap Star Wars and if that's the case I just don't have any time to watch Star Wars in general because it hasn't been good in a long time a long time but all these rumors stem from the fact that Star Wars has been mismanaged so poorly over the last few years people are desperate for some good news to come out of that and it's usually in the form of bad news because lucasfilm has taken all this time to produce bad Star Wars content disrespect fans disrespect the characters and the legacy of these properties that people love fans are so dedicated to Star Wars they put their religion down as Jedi on some forms people are married in Star Wars themed weddings people have Star Wars themed houses but people don't have any of that based on the new Disney Star Wars Disney tried to have a Star Wars themed hotel that cost five thousand dollars for two nights and you know what it didn't work it's already going out of business in record time new Disney Star Wars is not good there's no doubt about that the numbers don't lie they don't spell anything but disaster for the brand and there's really no way to sugarcoat it you can't blame the fans you can't call them bigots you can't call them sexist you can't call them racist you can't blame the fans because the fans don't make these projects Leslie hedlin was quoted as saying one of the showrunners had never seen Star Wars and they took that as a term of endearment if I were in charge I would make sure the people writing my shows knew what Star Wars was lucasfilm used to have continuity editors lucasfilm used to have these people that were responsible for making sure that everything worked in the Star Wars universe and was it perfect no nothing is but it was damn close to it and Star Wars used to be a lot better many years ago it's not a bunch of delusional people living in the past it's fans whose voices are valid whose opinions are valid unlike the shows that we're forced to watch so folks thank you for watching I'll be back next time with more make sure you watch us on Tuesday nights for the high council at 9pm Eastern Standard Time this week's podcast on Thursday night will be a special review of Indiana Jones and the dial of Destiny we watch it so you don't have to so folks check that out at nine o'clock send in your messages have your voices heard on the channel and if you really want to know all about the movie and you don't want to spend a dime to watch it check out our video on the Indiana Jones and the dial of Destiny plot leaks they turned out to be true all of it so thank you for watching I'll be back next time with more but in the meantime be smart be safe be cool but always be excellent too if other thanks for watching today's video yes it's over but don't cry because there's more a lot more from world-class bullshitters and there's only one way to get it hit that subscribe button below when you do that you'll get notifications and updates for world-class bullshitters every time we go live basically you won't miss anything and if there's one thing I hate it's fomo but the thing most people hate more than fomo is fear of missing out on world-class

they're big enough as this but it does help us fight the algorithm here and well it's Man vs machine and that's the real fight but if that's not your battle that's okay there's one last way you can help WCBS and that's going over to shop wcbs.com picking up a t-shirt a beer glass a sweatshirt a poster all sorts of ways to back WCBS the difference between us and other YouTube channels is I'm the

Outro Music: ""Rise of the Heroes"" by Jon Wright",everything great about venom has been sponsored by wix [Music] [Applause] the black and white of the sony logo are kind of like venom's black and white no come on you you just fooling shaky cam amateur camera operator you know realism that's james oh good mary jane's interim boyfriend made it out alive whoop never mind this symbiote is kind of a murderous jerk i do love the body takeover effects though fixing compound fractures is a riot eddie brock's sizzle reel montage is the fastest way to flood my brain with tom's accent so i get used to it and also you know establish him as a hard-hitting journal there's no such thing as can that could be the mayans mc slogan are you gonna behave yourself tomorrow no at least he's honest about it no one should have expected anything different of the daily glow incident and i would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those meddling spider-men i can't really compliment the meaning behind this choice i mean i could make something up about the story not really being about these two and that eddie's obsession with the story supersedes all other things but the movie let's go with that idea pretty fast and really i just think cutting the music abruptly rather than fading it out slowly is a fun aesthetic choice that may have been just that fun realistic looking and career appropriate emails that are only on screen for a few seconds attention to detail at first i wondered why she was hobbling around since the symbiote had fixed her leg but then it occurred to me that there are still limits to what the human body can do and if you're just walking for miles and miles eventually you're gonna need some delicious eel heads could also be that it wasn't a perfect match for riot so like a lot of the hosts her organs are failing so riot is like a combination of quill and spike from the last stand old move sony bold move and also let's not forget hella because isn't her sword technically a symbiote do you ever feel like your life is like one monumental scholar nope reassurance give me a dollar for a song i'll throw in the paper as long as the song is amy man save me also i see claudia's coke addiction got the best of her not even john c reilly could save her okay that's a lot of references to make sure you're with me and you look as beautiful as ever compliments all around jay jonah's failure of a rival barney bushkin i may have been one of the few people who enjoyed the movement of the symbiote in spider-man 3 but sony upped the game for this iteration that's pretty brutal the symbiote seems pissed off like how have you not figured out what i'm compatible with yet are you the next volunteer you know when mona lisa saperstein is the reasonable person in your bad guy click that everyone else is crazy whoever you are you suck there are two instances in this movie of either a reshoot or some adr after the trailer was released and honestly they renew my faith in the process this is the first as if the director or hardy saw this back you suck whoever you are and thought now we can do better and then did whoever you are you suck it's pretty cool all the people that he took down yeah i was one of them the new boyfriend character of dan is he's a cliche dodge character he's just a nice dude who actually fanboys over eddie a little well done riders we call them symbiotes and thank goodness you do call them that this is the second fix from the trailers we call them symbiotes see people sometimes your voices are heard you know what they say science never sleeps that's the perfect crime some people may say that you don't know trying to save your old friend only to get a new friend [Music] now here's some fun lateral tracking through the woods with a tension building score that makes for a solid action set piece tree removal skills this isn't going to be the last of this kind of win but tom hardy's physical acting i realize he's getting some help from wires and effects here and there but you can already tell by his performance that venom is pulling him around garbage chicken which leads to an appropriate reaction what is wrong with me and another appropriate reaction let's just get this out of the way this movie is not the same movie without tom hardy interacting with tom hardy therefore tom hardy let's be honest here this has been a long time coming tom hardy is always a win if you're wondering why riot doesn't seem to be killing its host as fast as all the hosts drake has been using remember that it's been choosing its hosts it kills most people and then picks the best match i assume it's the same reason it's taken six months to get in an airplane just trying to find that perfect host hey guy with backpack wipe this is dead dead dude observations oh man this is a scene from very conscientiously considering eating dan's head to shushing the hostess to finally finding that live snack he needed good stuff please don't call the police okay call an ambulance i'm a doctor this man is my um patient you know props to danny eagan sorry i'm sure reed scott's done other great things but he's always gonna be the guy who is really mean to mike which means seeing him go out of his way for his girlfriend's ex is admirable one more improvement i'm just now deciding was an improvement from the trailer with the venom overlays rather than just the black creeping up his neck hey can you turn your music down please whatever negotiation skills you are making us look bad it takes a bit to get here but once you do it's worth it i'm so sorry about your friends politeness also again tom sells the idea that he's just a marionette with venom holding the strings saving a new fleshy buddy not quite as graceful as spidey but he's got the main idea great way to introduce these two to each other and sort of allows venom to exist in physical form before he exists in physical form this is beyond anything we thought it was possible seeing the bigger picture can't really knock him for it resourcefulness so fire does obviously hurt venom but you could also see it as a little foreshadowing that it won't necessarily kill him like he thinks goes out there doing something and it's some pretty good ingenuity having a good time also ludwig gorinson's score starts to pick up and have as much fun as eddie here i am going to die you are not going to die optimism with abilities to back it up pretty awesome healing factor that is unique from wolverines and an awesome transformation into full form venom just in general one of the most impressive and comic accurate portrayals chang and all i am venom those milky organic looking eyes hate a man love him could uh are you gonna eat anybody else most likely no you do not touch jimmy as my there's actually something really sweet about eddie trying to protect alvarez from venom dang it i love venom's voice just on the surface the bassy power creates this imposing image of venom in your head at all times but then the effects and the way it's mixed makes it feel like it's always surrounding you but inside your head at the same time also are we seeing this building through eddie's fear of heights vision seems a little taller and skinnier than it probably is you're far too good of a match to throw away so soon plus i am starting to like you friendship fast crappy nasty is that like a callback an instant callback really it's the first glimpses of eddie and venom's relationship and communication skills building i love it also badass good bad medium medium guy a visually fun fight with the added effect of the silhouette symbiote scatter away from any because of the flashbangs [Music] so i really like the synthy sound effect in the score that venom and actually i think all the symbiotes get but i couldn't place it at first and i finally figured out that it totally reminds me of the world engine we do not eat policemen no having a moral code never apologized you might not live to get another chance wow that's like relationship advice from black goo that eats people's heads okay so the movie does something here that i like to call respecting your audience nine million movies before this one with similar premises and similar scenes have had this similar character in disbelief until well far beyond all reason not only does she quickly realize venom is in the dog she also talks to venom you're using him no even tries to reason with venom when she finds out he's killing eddie you're killing him i guess eddie learned a few things from venom that is the ugliest looking thing i have ever seen [Music] cool-headedness still some expectation subversion he's just a reporter without venom she venom love i don't i'm not sure i feel about this what really made you change your i mind really like the relationship between eddie and venom what can i say tom hardy knows how to build a friendship with himself yeah trailer or not that's still brutal he hears god you have never seen what are our chances [Music] in general a wisecracking venom who knows his place is much more enjoyable to watch than the alternative it's not the best of the best cgi we've seen in the past few years but it's fun to watch it's over the top and you get a real sense of the power and speed of the symbiotes and they're able to be pretty brutal sans blood that's actually a pretty big deal is the first time eddie consciously chooses to reconnect with venom this is a pretty awesome cgi pan around super symbiote now the humans throwing real time slow motion bunches comparatively feels perfectly appropriate you're too late this is the next stage and a cliche dodge no monologuing for you drake and another stabbing our hero through the torso brutal have a nice life have a nice light call back [Music] that's some self-sacrifice she has no idea we are going to get her back phantom's alive and he's still working on eddie's relationships don't give up on her either of you stanley is always a win we miss you stan also appreciate the confirmation that he knows venom's in there solidifying that supernatural status rolling down the street like [Music] in the wind i think it was this joke that alerted people to the tone of this film and i think that was the right call no sense expecting an r-rated gore-fest when it's really a buddy cop action movie we are venom i have a parasite and just a little more honesty whoa eminem just got way too meta for me still win i appreciate that they throw hints out for the uber fans talking about bodies hey red so you could most likely figure out who it is there's gonna be carnage but then even the most uninitiated of us have at least heard of venom's nemesis so the stinger becomes more than just for the select few i like it and also this little teaser cannot wait to get to this bad boy so yeah just go see this if you haven't already i hate to complain about the movie not delivering on what the trailer promised because that's pretty much par for the course at this point trailers aren't meant to show you what the movie is about they're meant to get you to go to the movie which is why i love trailers because they're the best version of every movie but this line the way i see it we can do whatever we want would be more towards the beginning of the movie i was expecting to see might seem like a minor difference but the relationship alluded to between venom and eddie at the end is where i expected or maybe just hoped they'd be by the middle i thought we'd see more of them working together buddy buddy it just reminds me of the infamous amazing spider-man 2 trailer and that thing we all know happened the relationship between trailer houses producers and filmmakers is just getting worse as the people with the money decide the movie that was actually made will sell better if they pay someone else to convince us that it's a different movie you know oh well i'm still pretty happy with the movie we got i'm probably not the first to realize or even say this but letting venom have an origin story outside of spider-man opens up his world in a way that couldn't have happened if he was just eddie brock the guy trying to get revenge on peter barker his comic writers realized something similar when they moved him 3 000 miles away from spidey so that was the right call that said i do get why critics had problems with this film even if i still believe the ratings are lower than they should be the biggest issue i see is pacing although it didn't bother me my wife julia isn't the biggest comic book movie fan she mostly just entertains me and then is occasionally surprised by how good one is but the one exception to that rule is always origin stories she loves origin stories so venom's slightly drawn out prologue and setup didn't really bother either of us they probably could have combined the cold open with everything before the six month jump but ultimately it sets up eddie brock's downfall and gives him some time to spiral i've read a bunch of reviews that complain that venom can't decide on tone if you've watched my revenge of the sith video you know how i feel about mixing tones and personally i really like the blend of comedic dramatic and the occasional horror terror elements venom as a character is sort of goofy now let's bite all the heads off and follow up the [Music] it takes him a bit to reveal that but i really enjoyed it i've seen enough t2 homages now that it was refreshing to see venom be different i like her he's not just funny because he's so out of touch he's funny because he's funny and he admits to being a loser and somehow that shared loserdom makes their relationship and venom's sacrifice more impactful he's more real we probably have deadpool's success for our anti-hero not taking himself too seriously either of them i'm gonna go home chase myself around and we'll play hard to get but like i mentioned in the main section it would be silly to not sing tom hardy's praises yeah well we all knew he'd kill it but i was still impressed wonky dialogue that no man could sell popped up here and there but all in all just a solid character tom sells eddie as a real person going through some weird crap even if he isn't the most fleshed out character but hey what can you ever really know about us youtube weirdos but since eddie really wants to get back into the written word the best way for him to get those words out there would be to create a custom professional website using today's sponsor wix even with eddie's part-time bad guy heading job he'd have no trouble building a site with wix's all-inclusive editor they do all the background heavy lifting you just plug and play it's super intuitive and the results always speak for themselves so many different themes and templates to choose from and each is customizable one great thing is that if eddie gets sick of writing he can always fall back on his video style reporting and embed those videos right into the site with a click of a button it really is this easy to create a pro site eddie and more importantly you can create anything you want whether you're a novice a business owner or a professional website builder so check out the url on screen or click the link in the description to sign up and start building your site for your next project today you thought i'd forget about the teaser frame this is the one i've been looking forward to for a long time everyone who's seen the movie will probably recognize it immediately and the

Special thanks to Andrew Elliott (Stalli111: https://www.youtube.com/user/Stalli111  ) for editing this video!",[Applause] captain [Applause] midnight [Applause] this video is brought to you by curiosity stream a few years ago i made a youtube video explaining why i enjoyed that first venom movie i thought it was goofy had a ton of rough edges and cut corners but at the end of the day it was carried by the sheer strength of tom hardy's weird take on eddie brock and his relationship to venom now here i am talking about a new venom movie and in many ways i feel pretty similar about it let there be carnage is a movie that knows what worked well in that first film and doubles down on it giving us a venom that's more in line with the fun and goofy version of the character that you'll find in the ps1 spider-man game and some of the 90s comics i think it works eddie and venom often play like a classic comedy duo even down to the slapstick gags if that worked for you in the first movie like it did for me that'll probably still work for you here as the film is more than happy to lean into those elements but when the film decides to stray from its title character well that's when it's on much much shakier ground i want to get into both aspects of the film this week and why i think let there be carnage was so close to being something special but doesn't quite manage to get there before i do though i do want to mention that there will be spoilers some of them that i'm really looking forward to talking about so just be warned [Music] to me there's one big reason why venom is a lot better than the movie around him is here woody harrelson's carnage i'm gonna say it now i don't think this performance worked and the script does him no favors the movie opens up on a young cletus cassidy in the 90s played by an actor whose voice is being badly dubbed over by harrelson it was just such a weird choice so maybe people less familiar with woody harrelson won't even notice this but like he's a 60 year old man by 1996 he had been a regular cast member on cheers for six seasons starred in white men can't jump in natural born killers 96 was the year he was nominated for an oscar for the people versus larry flint at the age of 35 but when we meet him here he's in a home for unwanted children so he's got to be like 17 at the oldest why not just set that opening scene in 1986 where it's a little bit more plausible maybe this all seems pedantic and it didn't bother you at all but when you combine it with the bad voice dubbing just really started this movie on an awkward note for me thankfully after that scene the movie gets into the stuff it does pretty well play with a very funny and dysfunctional relationship of eddie brock and his venom symbiote and on that front at least this franchise has only gotten stronger under andy circus i know this version of the character isn't universally beloved among fans but honestly i'm still impressed with how much of a loser they're okay with depicting tom hardy's eddie as in today's blockbuster landscape where action stars like the rock and vin diesel have it built into their contracts that they can't lose a fight or ever appear too weak on screen hardy's performance remains refreshingly free of vanity and ego his brock is a sweaty constantly overwhelmed guy who lives in a cramped apartment with two chickens and is not exactly anyone's idea of an action hero he's not even a particularly good journalist the only big story he manages to break in the movie is as venom says the symbiote doing his job for him but then venom isn't exactly the ultimate hero either even more so than in the first film they do a good job of making this computer-generated goop feel like a real character he's full of bluster he's rash a bit cowardly and constantly in need of attention they make for a great pair of lovable losers and almost everything the movie does well can be chalked up to how much fun it is to watch them play off each other and while i'm complimenting the movie i might as well toss in a mention of how weirdly endearing i find the characters of anne and dan one thing that i see said a lot about these movies is that they completely waste michelle williams and i gotta say i think i disagree williams plays a lot of deeply sad characters whether it's the grieving mother of manchester by the sea or the woman fighting to survive on the oregon trail in meek's cut-off she's not exactly known for her lighthearted performances here she gets to cut loose and have a good time that scene of her flirting with venom at the convenience store lets her play material that she isn't known for doing in earnest sundance dramas and dan is just a solid comedic foil constantly there to be the jerry smith of the group making for another solid character for venom to play off of so if i enjoyed all these things about it why is the title of this video fairly negative to me there's just one big issue that this movie can't quite overcome carnage everything that this movie does well with venom making him feel like a real character a symbiote with a fleshed-out personality and point of view it just drops the ball on with carnage it kind of feels like the movie knows the tone that it's going for when venom is on screen but is completely lost when he already isn't i feel like they had a couple options they could have gone with when it comes to carnage one is to make him truly dark and scary taking his depravity seriously and trying to play the serial killer stuff and his relationship with shriek without a hint of camp that probably would have made a lot of carnage fans happy but it would have been a really odd fit for the tone of the rest of the film the other would have been to embrace the camp turn everything up to 11 and play carnage and shriek scenes just as comedically as the venom and brock relationship instead i feel like the movie tries to split those options right down the middle and the result is that carnage and shriek end up feeling very undercooked i think circus needed to make some bolder choices with characterization here because as it is carnage comes off as just a little boring and say what you will about carnage he's often ridiculous and over the top but he's not usually dull so that's a problem woody harrelson his cletus doesn't go nearly as big or as intense as i was expecting but an even bigger problem is that the carnage symbiote is barely an active and present voice in the movie at all i mean really what do we know about carnage apart from cletus in the movie he doesn't like shriek because her powers hurt him and he doesn't like venom because he was born from venom and that's basically it i often find carnage obnoxious but at least he usually has a strong personality in this movie his symbiote mostly comes off as venom but boring i actually think the idea that venom defeats carnage because he and eddie are a good match while carnage and cletus aren't is a perfectly good one but if the carnage material had just been a little bit more better written they could have actually done something with that dynamic create an interesting story for carnage beyond just using shriek as a plot device and almost nothing else as it stands i think venom's hilarious last line to cletus is mostly there to paper over the fact that cletus himself was so underwritten so that's where my big problem comes from in this movie i enjoy a lot of it and i like that these movies are willing to be far more goofy than your average marvel film but at the end of the day carnage was half the film and it just didn't quite feel like anyone was trying very hard with him here harrelson just kind of seems like he's collecting a paycheck and the symbiote himself is pretty bland it's not a fatal blow to the movie but it does make me think there's still a better comedic venom movie out there still waiting to be made but i guess i should finally talk about the tom holland of it all bummer you're in the doghouse now dude well i had been spoiled going into the film that he would make an appearance but the way they did it was a lot weirder than i was expecting and not in a bad way really i enjoyed the scene but it left me with a lot of questions like why is peter parker standing in public without his mask on was that supposed to be taking place during the battle at the end of far from home it didn't really seem like it because his face and costume weren't beat up at all so maybe this is something that happens in no way home or right before it i honestly have no idea but it seemed like a really weird clip of peter for the media to have then again i could just be overthinking this there's also the fact that venom seems to transport eddie to another dimension or universe when he's talking about all the things he could show him or maybe their dimensional shift was just the result of what doctor strange does and no way home again i have no idea and i'm pretty torn on if i think tom hardy will show up in no way home at all it seems like the kind of dimension hopping movie that they could stick him into for at least a cameo but marvel studios is still heavily involved in the holland films and they don't exactly seem quick to embrace venom's little side universe all that said though i think what this scene does do is make sony's intentions clear they really want to have venom and holland spidey really share the screen at some point in the future i have no idea when and how that will happen but it seems like a fairly safe bet that it will which i'm not opposed to while i'm not super excited for things like the morbius movie i do really like hardy's take on this character and i think putting him in a film with hall and spider-man who can handle the comedic stuff well would be a recipe for some great scenes it's definitely a weird move though so i'm interested to see what you all have to say in the comments below oh and if you're looking for content on an even weirder comic book movie i do have a video on angley's hulk film that's live right now on nebula that's just one of many exclusive videos that i've posted

The chase led to Tulara Ravine, and the two Twi’leks spotted the Ghost coming in to scoop them up after making a difficult supply run. Charging back towards their pursuers, the Ghost took out the armored transport and scooped up Cham and Numa along with the Blurggs and a Scout Trooper. As they flew away, Cham brought up some bad news for Hera; the Empire now occupied the Tann Province which was where Hera grew up. Cham and his followers fought hard to defend their home against the Imperials led by Captain Slavin. He described his previous attacks to be clumsy which gave Cham an advantage in keeping the Empire from taking their home. But he underestimated his recent attack, which was swift and precise. Cham lost Tann Province to the Empire which had now been turned into an Imperial headquarters for Captain Slavin. He and his followers escaped but left behind family treasures.

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",these are some important details about Grand Admiral thrawn's Star Destroyer which you might have missed and might explain why he hasn't run out of fuel after 10 years the Chimera is a modified Imperial one-class Star Destroyer that was commanded by Grand Admiral thrawn during the reign of the Galactic Empire and onwards into this post Empire Era its most notable feature is the illustration of a three-headed creature called the Chimera thrawn became acquainted with the symbol after someone from a world called repack gave him a ring from his family clan in fear his species would become extinct at the hand of their conquerors and entrusted the ring to thrawn which depicts three-headed monster as Thorne Rose in the ranks of the Empire to Commodore he was given command of his own star destroyed which he named after what he had already adopted as his personal symbol military Starship would display the symbol on its ventral surface and even the officers that served under him had a depiction of the creature on their uniforms during the liberation of lothal the pergol took the Chimera to hyberspace with both Ezra and thrawn never to be seen again until Morgan ellsbeth along with balance arrive on peridia by this point the ship looks battle worn with extensive visible damage done specifically on both sides of the ship where the star whales grabbed it before taking it to hyperspace now it's likely thrawn has spent most of the 10 years he's been on prettier collecting resources to travel back to the main Star Wars Galaxy but I think it's also likely he's called upon the great Mother's magic to help prepare the ship in a similar way to how magic was used to recreate Darth Maul's legs and this would explain how the ship is still functional after all these years even if thrawn has collected Fuel and supplies but it's also likely pretty it didn't have these supplies so he might have needed to rely on Knight sister's magic actually get the ship up and running again

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",a lot of people seem to think that Ezra has learned the dathomir magic the same magic we see used by the night Sisters by Mother talzin by Marin and this comes from the speculation that there's going to be a lot more to Ezra than we first thought it almost seems like he's hiding something you'll notice his outfit and the way he's dressed he's actually wearing a very similar color red robes to what the night sisters wear which is also the same color of cloth the night Troopers have used to stitch up their armor implying that they are perhaps also a creation of this magic Ezra has spent a long time alone on prettier something close to 10 years so it seems likely that during this time he would have increased his skills learn some new abilities and perhaps dabbled a little bit in the dark magic

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",this is possibly one of the most important scenes in the latest episode of Ahsoka she is on a false errand indeed you may follow her at your own pace yes G I thought you were to honor your agre did you catch it the writing on the walls of the temple that FR and the KN sisters have been residing in is those of the Zeo the Zeo Was a Race introduced in Star Wars Jedi Fallen order and predates many events in Star Wars history long story short they eventually became more and more corrupt fell to the dark side and nearly went extinct the last remaining zonian fled into regions unknown in attempt to find peace and start a new so why is there a Temple in Ruins and no Zeo are to be found well it's possible they never did find what they were looking for but we know FR and the night sisters aren't just wanting to leave the planet they're trying to escape an unknown power beyond them so Star Wars isn't hiding the fact that the Zeo are involved in some way but I personally don't think they're the unknown power more likely the Zeo fell victim to it since we've already seen Undead Knight Troopers in the latest episode perhaps it's a similar power that have taken over the Zeo race as a host for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

Train
""50 Ways To Say Goodbye""

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Bridge]
I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love...
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

[Hook 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

[Hook 2]
She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

123,GV4zXkmHpPI,2013-08-20T04:25:09Z,Anchor loses it in Grumpy Cat interview,"Australian Today Show host Karl Stefanovic wasn't prepared for this particular difficult talk show guest.

The internet's arguably most famous feline, Grumpy Cat, was invited for an in-depth interview, but showed herself unimpressed with Stefanovic's interrogation.

The host grilled his guest about her fame, her upcoming book, and about Australian politics; all questions she stoically frowned upon. (She is a cat after all.)

Stefanovic bravely played along for a while before cracking up after the cat pulled a particularly grumpy face when Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott was mentioned.

Grumpy Cat rose to internet fame last year after Bryan Bundesen, the brother of Grumpy Cat's owner, Tabatha Bundesen, posted some pics of the cat (real name Tardar Sauce) on Reddit.

""It was an accident,"" Bundesen said. ""We thought it would get some laughs, with the Internet liking cats. And it just kept going.""

There's no doubting Grumpy Cat's star power:

The official website attracts more than 1.5 million visitors a month and the official Facebook page has more than 1.1 million likes.  

On top of that Grumpy Cat was voted Meme of the Year Award at the 2013 Webby Awards, named most influential cat of 2012 by MSNBC, has appeared on news shows and in magazines around the world and made a small fortune from merchandising deals.

She is now set to appear in her own movie.",grumpycat good morning are you happy to be doing doing this interview with The Today Show in Australia what about the opposition leader Tony Abbott it's like Java the hot

It felt very extragalactic with the Purggil graveyard orbiting the planet and the ancient statues spralled across the surface of the planet.
#ahsoka #disney #starwars #thrawn",Ahsoka did a lot of things really well in its sixth episode but one of my favorite aspects was the planet paridia paradia whatever this planet truly felt extra Galactic like there's something very just not quite right there's a conversation between Shin and Valen where it's described as being Madness something out of a dream and yeah from the first scene we see that the planet's not surrounded by an asteroid field of rocks rather Pergo corpses and Bones then things continue to get weird on the surface you get a quick shot of a statue's face and it looks like it's in fear or in pain you see more of the statues and they're just abruptly shooting out of the landscape in a very off-putting way then everything is just not quite right like the environment's weird I saw a face in the Rocks here I don't know if that's a statue or just me seeing things where they don't exist but when you combine it with thrawn's decaying but held together a ship and that's equally true more so really of his Stormtroopers something very weird is going on here as capped off by balin's statement of there being some very dark threat that we don't quite understand yet

It is the sixth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to be produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. Slater serves as head writer with Mohamed Diab leading the directing team.

Oscar Isaac stars as Marc Spector / Moon Knight, a mercenary who has dissociative identity disorder, with May Calamawy, Karim El-Hakim, F. Murray Abraham, and Ethan Hawke also starring. The series was announced in August 2019, with Slater hired in November. Diab was hired to direct four episodes in October 2020, with directing duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead joining in January 2021 to direct the other two. Isaac was confirmed to star at that time, and used different accents to differentiate Spector's various identities. Filming took place from April to October 2021, primarily in Budapest as well as in Jordan, Slovenia, and Atlanta, Georgia.

Moon Knight premiered on March 30, 2022, and is scheduled to run for six episodes until May 4. It is part of Phase Four of the MCU. The series has received positive reviews, with particular praise for Isaac's performance",

May the Force be with YOU.... Always!",two things I noticed in episode six Balin finally reveals how he survived Order 66 and how he knows Anakin became Darth Vader and another thing is that he actually tells us that he trained shinhadi to be something more than just a broken Jedi you know it's important to note that when Baylen discusses his history Shin immediately fills in the story by mentioning the Jedi Temple because she likely has heard the story before from her master although it seems that balen does not reveal everything to shinhadi at once she is slowly but surely understanding what balen thinks this suggests that balen was actually at the Jedi Temple he talked about I saw everything I cherished burn meaning Order 66 happened and he was inside the temple he watched it burn if this is the case and balen saw dozens of Jedi being slaughtered by the Clones plus he tells shinhadi that there was no future at the Jedi Temple for him the unnecessary Carnage of Order 66 taught him the true weakness of the Jedi now according to Balon he he saw the Jedi Temple burn this means that he saw Anakin's raid on the temple during Revenge of the Sith meaning that he is an exclusive member of the Jedi Survivor club that escaped the Jedi Temple many Jedi survivors were outside doing missions and that's how they actually managed to escape but those who were inside the temple very few got away like Riva like caloran Beck and grogu however now we officially know how balen knew to telesoka few saw what Anakin became afterwards meaning joyth Vader because once accepting the moniker of Darth Vader and accepting the dark side Palpatine as his master he wasn't in his suit yet so Balon actually saw Anakin as a Sith Lord without his suit again only a few Jedi knew of the true destiny of Anakin because the Empire promoted the news that Anakin Skywalker had died inside the Jedi Temple together with other Jedi this is why Vader says that Anakin is dead constantly but alas we have speculated for a while because even in the trailers we saw Balin had knowledge of Anakin becoming better now we have a full understanding of how he actually knew this but it doesn't stop there because if grogu almost had an encounter with Anakin inside the temple and the Clones if Riva was injured and didn't die by the hand of Anakin Vader then I believe that balen intercepted Vader inside the temple as well he might have killed a few clones and then come face to face with the newly christened Sith Lord one of two things I think likely happened between Balin and Anakin's encounter either Vader failed to kill Balin similar to Riva he perhaps injured him thought he was dead continued on his mission and balen later survived or he actually chose to spare balen's life you see if balen was disillusioned even back then similar to Count Dooku who formed saw the fall of the Jedi then Anakin would have possibly felt the disappointment Brewing inside of Balin and perhaps attempted to recruit him there are many speculations out there that I don't truly believe but it would be pretty interesting there are speculations out there by the fans that Balin might have been Vader's secret Apprentice he is the Starkiller in Canon an older Starkiller now this would explain that that if Vader dueled balen and in fact defeated him why he showed Mercy in the end and did not finish the job regardless of what actually happened we see that in episode 6 the discussion of the Jedi Order explains exactly why Balin moved away from the Jedi he even tells shinhadi that he trained her to be more than just a Jedi so in many ways balon's belief in the Jedi was similar to that of Count Dooku we see now because he saw how the order degraded itself in Petty Paul politics and other Galactic squabbles whether during the Clone Wars for example the Jedi became generals and soldiers he even has that title as we see Grand Admiral thrawn calls him General balance skull this probably is why balen was disappointed in the Jedi he probably hated the moniker of General he was a keeper of the peace when he started as a Jedi Padawan and as a Jedi Knight now he needed to be a general something that might not have agreed with the ethics of Balin at the time as a Jedi in balin's mind the Jedi Order would have continued spiraling downwards in their endless struggle for power they even went as far as trying to Dethrone the chancellor whether that was a good plan or not a good idea or not to not let a Sith rule the Republic it just showed how bad the the situation had gotten for the Jedi Order they were trying to Dethrone a leader of the Republic as a matter of fact but now we see that he seeks to end the cycle once and for all who is calling to him I made a video just previously about it and I would love to know what are your thoughts as well

Catch the full streams & videos here: https://www.youtube.com/battlefrontupdates",so an absolutely huge thing was just figured out in regards to Ahsoka episode 6 Tommy wall out on Twitter managed to translate these runes that show up when Balin and shin are leaving the night sister Temple as these runes are actually part of the old Sith language Ur kitat and for some reason it's simply been flipped 180° so what this translates to is roughly praise cette ruler of all May's reain last for a l so it probably says something like last for all eternity and if you don't know kuet is actually the dark side SEO from Star Wars Jedi Fallen order an ancient species that was extremely strong in the force and was actually confirmed to have left the other Galaxy and this is definitive proof that the SEO actually went to peridia this is actually huge as it means that this isn't a nightsister temple it's actually a SEO Temple we knew these runes look looked similar to seho runes we saw in the game but the fact that this spells out the dark side seho that basically made their entire species fall to the dark side kuet means that it is by 100% a SEO Temple and it's not unlikely that the SEO has something to do with what the KN sisters are fleeing from and what balen skull is searching I thought this was a huge find as it's not just speculation but actual a spelled out reference to jet the old SEO Sage 
155,4_5SDlElOK8,2023-09-22T22:54:16Z,This is an incredibly dark detail...,"One aspect of Ahsoka fans are praising is the portrayal of Ezra Bridger in live action but one of the coolest details of the character is a dark call back to something from Star Wars Rebels.
#starwars #disney #ahsoka #thrawn #starwarsrebels #ezrabridger",Ezra bridger's appearance in the latest episode of Ahsoka is getting a ton of Praise from fans of Star Wars Rebels everything from the faithfulness of the performance to the evolution of the character's look following the finale of rebels is getting a ton of positive feedback and I'm truly excited to see where the character goes from here can we talk about the incredible work the costume designers put into this outfit though it Sports a really awesome detail that I didn't notice upon a first viewing of the episode The chainmail Ezra's wearing looks like it's made from just scraps of metal but if you look closely it's actually made up of the dog tags of Fallen Stormtroopers not only is this just awesome cosmetically but it also serves a function it makes a lot of sense for the character being stranded in another galaxy doesn't give everybody there a ton of options when it comes to metalworking so naturally he would use what he had available it also ties into the character's knack for collecting Stormtrooper helmets as memorabilia in Star Wars Rebels what do you think about this detail though let us know in the comments down below and click on screen for another video

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",have you noticed that while watching Ahsoka every scene in which balance skull appears up until this episode he was the commanding figure the alpha in the room and the one who felt completely in control of the situation that was until he met Grand Admiral thrawn who seemed to really suss him out and almost overpower him overshadow him not only with his reputation but with his scene presence I thought this was a really interesting power Dynamic and I saw a bunch of you leaving comments about this saying that Balin is being outmatched which is especially the case seeing as though thrawn doesn't really care what happens to Balin skull and shin Hattie they weren't part of his plan originally and he now has no trust in them as Ahsoka is still alive which balen seems to think otherwise on really excited to see how this plays out and who gets the upper hand over the other in the end

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",oh my gosh guys look they put Elon Musk in Star Wars this is like literally one of the most dramatic entrances for any character ever in Star Wars also wait why why is thrawn fat they made him fat he's been getting fat kind of adds a bit of personality to him to be honest wait he only looks big from certain angles other other times he's fine he looks like a general how why is there a problem with him being fat I think it adds character no need for his dude yeah honestly though Lars Mickelson feels like the perfect casting for thrawn having played him in Star Wars Rebels he understands the character possibly better than anyone and I think most people agree is capturing the essence of what thrawn is all about you're quite right also don't you guys think it's kind of funny he's still wearing the badges on his uniform it's like mate the Empire's no more why are you still wearing the badges your rank means nothing

#StarWars #ahsoka",episode 6 of Ahsoka gave us a lot more Balin and shin than we've seen so far especially shin and it really raised the question of what Shin knows about balin's plans and goals or even just what she herself is she seemed incredibly curious about the Jedi all episode and when Baylen mentions Ezra being a specific kind of broken Jedi train outside the temple Shin likened herself to that as well implying along with her braid that she sees herself as a Jedi in some sense much to Balin Chagrin who says he's training her to be something more when Baylen was talking about the cycle she says doesn't that mean it's our turn which if she's buying into the cycle could mean that after the Empire the hour she's referring to there are the Jedi since it's really starting to seem like balen is giving her a lot of mixed signals about what she is or just not giving her the whole answer about what they're doing the more she's seen of balin's plans and the more he's gone against his word to Sabine especially the less enthusiastic she's looked and the more she seemed to question what they're doing she's clearly not comfortable with the witches and doesn't want to be on prettiest so I'm in interested to see where that goes for both of them

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",during the build up to thrawn's first appearance in Ahsoka we hear this big musical cue [Music] [Music] music plays a big part in Star Wars and thrawn is no exception one of the most iconic pieces of music in Star Wars Rebels is named thrawn's web which is used in many of his scenes in the series in fact the character as a whole is associated strongly with the use of an organ so it's of no surprise that they use the exact same instrument for his appearance in Ahsoka but it's not so straightforward the sound of the organ is distorted with the Distortion growing with each key being played it's something so slight you might need the use of headphones but it signifies something isn't right something so seriously wrong that thrawn's iconic theme cannot be played properly whether that be due to his broken down state this ominous power on the planet himself and the Knight sisters are trying to escape from or the magic used to supplement his army is unknown but I'm sure we'll find out sooner or later for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",Captain Enoch is a new character garnering a lot of attention specifically with his design what's interesting is Enoch's gold embedded into the fractures of his armor this is called kinsugi a Japanese repair practice that gives an object a story and items undergone such techniques are considered even more precious than before for the writer of Ahsoka Dave filoni this isn't something new as he's confessed in the past that he's a full-blown weeb and anything he touches that is Star Wars is heavily inspired by many Japanese Medias especially samurais the final Jewel between Ahsoka and Marik is a direct reference to Akira kurosawa's 1962 Samurai film sanjuro many of filoni's episodes of The Clone Wars was also in reference to kurosara and the scene of grogu's choice given by Luke Skywalker in the book of Boba Fett was inspired by Lone Wolf and Cub and the list goes on so Enoch is not the first nor the last reference to Japanese Culture by filoni in Star Wars for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

#StarWars #ahsoka",a lot of Star Wars fans take their ships very seriously so the reappearance of chimera caused some controversy when people thought the model was wrong for the iconic ship in Canon the Chimera as we saw it in Rebels was an imperial one class which you can most easily identify against the two by its taller x-shaped conning Tower above the bridge as well as by the turrets the isd2 basically flips that conning Tower sideways so with this main shot of the ship people assumed Ahsoka had made a big mistake but if you look closely you can see it is not a mistake at all for one thing the turrets we can see here match the isd1 style rather than the isd2 octuple turrets the difference in the bridge can be explained by the repairs after the Pergo attack in Rebels despite now being installed horizontally during those repairs like it is on the isd2 you can still see some signs that we are dealing with a modified isd1 Tower most notably this middle support strut which is only visible on the isd-1 it's not present on the two at all what might be a mistake is not subscribing to datapad briefs if you want to hear more about pointless stuff like this

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",what do you think Ezra's been up to for all these years because he's actually been stranded on peridia for roughly 10 years has he just been living with the note he this entire time or has he seen what thrawn is up to and is planning a way to stop him from coming into Power I think it's also interesting to note that not only Ezra has been here for 10 years but also thrawn he's been stuck here for a full 10 years which is a long time to wait even for someone as patient and cunning as thrawn I really hope we get to see more of peridia and learn more about this planet's past and whether thrawn and Ezra have been exploring its past this entire time

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",Enoch is the captain of the guard for Grand Admiral thrawn's night Troopers his helmet appears to be inspired by a traditional Japanese Samurai masks but not only that his name is quite intriguing I think is a Biblical reference to Enoch the patriarch who is present in the Book of Genesis and lived for 365 years before he was taken by God to Heaven Enoch walked with God and he was no more for God took him so based on this an Enoch's actual character in Ahsoka it would almost seem to imply that Enoch is in fact Undead that he is somehow perhaps a creation of the dathmirian mother's magic or something else unknown is at play now I'm starting to think that morocc created from the night sisters magic was a precursor introducing us to the idea of this kind of villain an army and characters created using the death Marian Magic

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",one of the most iconic scenes in the latest episode of Ahsoka was this one in the subtitles of the episode we realized these gruesome soldiers are named night Troopers with the biggest change being the red rope wrapped around the armor this is the same rope color as the night sisters and with Knight being in the name it's heavily suggested that these Troopers are no longer living and are zombified by night sister magic this matches the power demonstrated by the night sister mother tausin in the Clone Wars who was able to revive and reconstruct more also similar to the Knights of the magic that kept a maroc alive and gave sauvage a press a strong connection to the force notice the Green Smoke dissipating from the body when they die we also hear the malformed monotone chant of thrawn from the Troopers during the scene as well giving an undead feel about the Army for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

Catch the full streams & videos here: https://www.youtube.com/battlefrontupdates",so one question that I still have after episode 6 of Ahsoka is just throw no does he know Papa thing is dead does he know that the empire fell and that the Galaxy is now in control of the new Republic it kind of feels like he does but he shouldn't really because how would he know I at least interpret it as the only communication that has happened is that the Knight sisters have been able to use their dark magic to kind of talk to Morgan ellsbeth in her dream and tell her about thrawn and how to get there because when she actually gets there they actually ask her did you see us in your dreams and she says yes so it doesn't sound like it was a two-way communication maybe the night Sisters still somehow was able to gather information about the known Galaxy and that way throw on knows because I don't think he's under the impression that the Empire is still ruling Palpatine is alive or really anything like that but I'm just curious if he does know everything that happened with the Empire and the new Republic how did he find out was it simply due to the dark magic of the night sisters or were they somehow able to send messages back and forth because it doesn't really sound like Morgan elspeth was able to send anything to thrawn's location but Throne was able to send vague messages through the night sisters magic but what do you guys think does he know the situation or is he in for a big Awakening

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",you probably didn't notice this unless you're watching Ahsoka episode 6 with subtitles but Grand Admiral Thorn's Army of Stormtroopers are actually called night Troopers as in it's possible some of these Remnant Stormtroopers are actually night brothers and sisters or perhaps they are not real at all and instead something similar to morocc a creation of the dmean dark magic that will cause them to burst into a cloud of green Flames upon fatal injury there's also a chance they are Undead as in Undead night brothers and night sisters similar to the villains you face in Jedi Fallen order but there's definitely something more to them that will be revealed in a later episode you might have also noticed them chanting so clearly they're observing something more than what regular Stormtroopers used to believe in

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka #starwarsoutlaws",the opening scene of a soccer is filled with multiple references not only to The Phantom Menace but also to Star Wars Rebels first of all these true dark Jedi in shinhati and Bale and skull arriving on the new Republic ship and still wearing their hoods is largely reminiscent of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn arriving on the Trade Federation ship at the start of the phantom menace to negotiate balance skull even repeats a line as said by Obi-Wan but changes the ending you were right about one thing Master you're by one thing Captain the negotiations were short we are no Jedi and this line as said by balance goal is of course a direct reference to what Ahsoka says to Darth Vader during their duel in the Sith temple in Star Wars Rebels I am no Jedi we are no Jedi and these aren't the only references to other Star Wars films in the opening Maitland's call opening Morgan ellsbeth's cell is also likely reminiscent of Luke busting layer out during a new hope it's a little short for a stormtrooper foreign 
207,XUbBJXRobJY,2023-09-20T18:52:32Z,We've seen these before,"The nightsister cargo that Thrawn is helping transport might be something we've seen before on Dathomir and could be a hint of what's to come!

Catch the full streams & videos here: https://www.youtube.com/battlefrontupdates",so something very interesting in episode 6 of Ahsoka is the partnership between thrawn and the Knight sisters as they've obviously made a deal where they help him out with their dark magic to contact Morgan ellispeth and from what a lot of us are guessing maybe enhance his Stormtroopers or basically reanimating his Stormtroopers and in return he will help them out of their Exile and also transport all the cargo from the catacombs to the other Galaxy and we can see multiple scenes here where they're seemingly transporting caskets or sarcophaguses how or however you pronounce it and this is really interesting as it could literally just be like night sister corpses that they are planning to reanimate but it also makes me think of this scene in Rebels where Ezra mall and the rest of the crew ends up on dathomir and basically Knight sister ghosts attack them and possess Kanan among others and all of this power and the ghosts actually came from the caskets or the altar or whatever you want to call it and once Astra destroys it the ghosts kind of go away so the Knight sisters are definitely cooking up something very interesting and I'm curious what all of this cargo that's apparently gonna take three days to load could be is it just like thousands of night sister corpses or what do you guys think

211,LVa9Rm6nn8c,2023-09-13T04:51:53Z,Ahsoka Episode 5 - Ending Scene - Darth Vader Vs Ahsoka - Full Fight (HD),"‘Ahsoka’ Episode 5 Recap: Chasing the Ghosts of Better Stories..""Shadow Warrior"" reunites Snips with SkyGuy, but to what end? Now that we have officially crossed the midway point for Ahsoka, Dave Filoni has returned to not only pen Episode 5, titled “Shadow Warrior,” but to direct it as well. With the episode simultaneously airing in theaters across the country, it appears that Filoni is trying to prepare himself for a silver-screen debut, though it seems that he still needs to hone his craft. Cinematic digital landscapes and dramatic Light Side vs. Dark Side duels can only go so far, and this week’s episode underscores that. It chases after the ghosts of better stories, clinging to their spectral tendrils in hopes of drawing from the emotions they once inspired in the hearts of fans. The episode opens where “Fallen Jedi” left off, with Hera (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) searching for answers about what happened to Ahsoka (Rosario Dawson) and Sabine (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) before she and Carson (​​Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) were able to reach them. After a short while, she discovers Huyang (David Tennant) perched on the cliff face, mourning the apparent loss of Ahsoka and Sabine, in a way that he knows best — fretting over the fact that they didn’t listen to his warning about staying together. But we know Ahsoka isn’t gone, at least not yet. As last week’s episode revealed in its final moments, Ahsoka’s fall into the ocean sent her into the World Between Worlds, where she finds herself once again face-to-face with her former master, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Anakin looks far less like his computer-generated and de-aged son this week, though the uncanny valley in their de-aging persists, made worse by the playful barbing between the characters about aging. Ahsoka questions what happened to her, and Anakin goads her with a blunt answer: “You lost a fight.” She does remember some of what happened to her in her final moments, which Anakin reveals is a good thing. If she still remembers what happened, then there’s still a chance for her to survive the whole ordeal. Rather than answering her questions, Anakin informs Ahsoka that he has come to her to finish her training — which doesn’t make much sense. Ahsoka famously left the Jedi Order and is no longer a Jedi and Anakin… well, we all know what Anakin did. Furthermore, Star Wars has been stuck in a rut with the idea that so many of its female characters need to train or to be shown training, while Luke Skywalker is left to build a new Jedi Order. We also know how that went. Worse yet, Ahsoka’s “training” stands in the place of actual storytelling. By driving Ahsoka and Anakin straight into a duel, we’re robbed of dialogue and character moments that could heighten the story that Filoni is attempting to tell. Filoni mistakenly believes that what audiences have been longing for is another poorly lit lightsaber duel — only this time between Anakin and Ahsoka — but that isn’t what anyone has been pining for. Especially not casual fans who know who Anakin is, but have no concept of why this duel with Ahsoka should matter to them. Even fans of The Clone Wars haven’t been looking forward to this, regardless of whether they've wanted Ahsoka and Anakin to reunite. We don’t want them to fight; we want them to talk, though, that’s a wish far too steep to be granted by Star Wars. Anakin cuts through the platform they’re standing on, sending Ahsoka careening downward like the opening credits of Kingdom Hearts, though it’s not quite simple or clean. She is thrown backward into a flashback of the Clone Wars, with Ahsoka once again inhabiting her younger self (Ariana Greenblatt) — though the foggy, poorly lit sequence offers a mere facsimile of the emotional tension and writing that the animated series once offered. Star Wars used to be vibrant and alive, but these flashbacks depict none of that by trading practical sets and unique locations for the murkiness of a fog-filled soundstage.",I didn't expect to see you so soon but I could you look old you lost a fight I don't remember trust me you lost it means you still have a chance tell me what's going on I'm here to finish your training it's a little late for that one is never too old to learn snips what's the lesson master live or die all right [Music] [Music] [Music] I haven't taught you everything yet forward hurry up next this was one of our first missions why are we here you tell me wait gotta keep up this is your training [Music] all right we'll be right back come on snips the battle's not over yet there are more separate asteroids approaching us is there a problem we lost so many there's always a price to be paid it was my fault they were following my orders This Is War I'm so good as Jedi it's our job to lead that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes you must adjust to the times look when Obi-Wan taught me we were keepers of the peace is that all I'll have to teach my own Padawan one day how to fight you know teaching is not always cracked up to be really what makes you say that I'm joking listen I'm teaching you how to lead how to survive do that you're going to have to fight what if I want to stop fighting and you'll die foreign I don't know this battle this was the siege of Mandalore we had parted Ways by now you did well you're a warrior now Ahsoka within you will be everything I am all the knowledge I possess we're part of legacy but my part of that Legacy is one of death and War you are more Anakin but more powerful and dangerous than anyone realized you've learned nothing don't don't say that I gave you a choice live or die [Music] conviction trying to die I choose to live There's Hope for you yet [Music] Anakin [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] how long have I been out one rotation however you might have been lost for good if not for Jason okay I owe you my thanks I heard you fighting hey I have an idea if you're going why don't you show Jason inside your Starship come along I'll show you the training room you have a training room in your Starship will you train me no Ashoka family finds that Sabine had betrayed her but she knows that she has done out of Goodwill and probably she will help Ashoka out in the episode six which is the finale of the season and probably we'll see them reunite again in the last episode of

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",this moment in the latest episode of Ahsoka is one of Anakin's greatest moments ever for reasons that date back to Revenge of the Sith this is because Anakin now finally possesses the power that Palpatine promised him during this scene ironic can save others from death but not himself is it possible to learn this power not from a Jedi he proposed the power that could protect Padme something he's wanted since failing his mother so whilst there has been people his own power failed to protect he now has the ability to not just save Ahsoka from dying but also rebirth her into a much stronger being perhaps the greatest irony in Anakin's best moment here is that Palpatine promised him the dark side could help him achieve this power when in fact it was actually the light but what do you think let me know in the comments down below and for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

#Shorts #StarWars #StarWarsGaming",so we finally got the big man himself thrawn he has finally appeared in live action and honestly his introduction in this episode was absolutely amazing I'm not too sure they could have done it any better than they did the absolute aura that he had as he was walking down through his army walking up towards Morgan balen and shin he just looked so damn ominous and honestly think he's absolutely perfectly cast when it comes to being Laz wigglesson we all know that he was thrawn in the animated series that doesn't always translate to live action so there was still a little bit of skepticism there and I think rightly so because obviously like I said it doesn't always work out well but I think he is absolutely nailed that role already for only one episode in and I honestly just think he is perfect as the moon and although there were so many other actors that I really wanted to see taking on the role of thrawn before they announced the casting I'm more than willing to eat my words because Lars Mickelson has absolutely killed it in his very first appearance in live action as Grand Admiral thrawn if you enjoyed this clip be sure to check out my patreon where through weekly full episode reactions of every single new Star Wars Episode check out the link it down in the description

#Shorts #StarWars #StarWarsGaming",so we've just been introduced through one of the coolest looking Stormtroopers in the history of Star Wars if not in my opinion probably the single coolest looking Stormtrooper this character's name is Enoch he is essentially thrawn's right hand man and as you can see he has got this kind of gold-plated face on his stormtrooper helmet replacing what looks to be a damaged section of the original stormtrooper helmet that they've then replaced with that gold almost dathamerian statue looking face now we know that he is thrawn's right hand man but he seems to be pretty damn important the fact that thrawn actually introduces him to Morgan balen and shin if he was just a regular sort of brute type of character where he's not overly important he's just there as more of a bodyguard I don't think thrawn would have introduced him but it seems as though he is actually very important so I hope we find out a little bit more about Enoch I'm not too sure we will but either way he is definitely one of the coolest looking Stormtroopers that we have ever seen to date if you enjoyed this clip be sure to check out my patreon where I do weekly full episode reactions of every single new Star Wars Episode check out the link down in the description

Thrawn is here and he's got a whole legion of some of the craziest looking stormtroopers we've ever seen. Let's take a look at the meaning behind their broken armor wrapped together with red night sister ribbons. Have the Stormtrooper's discipline broken down? Are they decorating themselves now like tribal warriors? Or is something more sinister happening here?

six now as stars fans we always see the empires how shall I say it ruthlessly clean you know gleaming white plastered armor sterile and cold looking Imperial class Star Destroyers gray on the outside more white on the inside there's no decoration no personality no sign that there are humans inside all of that armor there's almost an obsession to how clean everything looks and so seeing thrawn's Chimera approach Over the Horizon looking like an old Chevy Impala with missing hubcaps and the wrong color replacement body panels all over it was definitely surprising thought to myself oh my God the jawa's got a run of the place they're like the organic Buzz droids of the Stars Galaxy terrifying and if the chimera's appearance surprises you wait till you see these crazy looking Stormtroopers inside of the hold the second you get close enough you realize that day two are in a really shoddy State I mean some of these guys have replacement panels on their helmets and their armor these are unpainted panels because you know you don't want to Fork over 300 extra credits to get it painted Factory white I mean some of these Stormtroopers even have cracks in their plastoid which reveals a golden or metallic Sheen underneath and of course you have those night sister ribbons wrapped all across their armor I believe this is more than just decoration it might even be witchcraft but yeah this is this is really cool you know in the aftermath novels we learned about what happened to the Empire once the emperor is dead and the logistical chain breaks apart and thrawn's Troopers here look a lot like how I imagined the Stormtroopers Garrison and jakku would have looked they were just basically waiting around for the final battle to occur there's a complete breakdown in discipline by this point in time and you know the Imperial Army had more or less just fainted away already it was only really these fnatic Stormtrooper Legions that were still hanging around but even then being quartered on a desert planet with only chip based rations and Facilities meant that the Stormtroopers armors started degrading the sand started scruffing the surfaces of their armor that strict cleaning regulation that existed while they were stationed on board ships and bases more or less disappeared some of these Stormtroopers actually go tribal they start painting their helmets with war paint they start adding memorabilia and little trinkets onto their armor this would have been completely against regulations back in the day and as discipline continues to slide you know the strong begin to Tower over the weak and Bully them things just are slowly falling apart they look less like the Empire's military and more like a warband the situation becomes very Apocalypse Now you know Into the Heart of Darkness and that is the vibe I'm getting from these Stormtroopers excuse me they're actually called night Trippers and this is a pretty big deal this is what really separates them from the jakku Imperial remnants yes they might look similar but I think there's something a little bit more Sinister going on here in peridia before we continue a quick word from our sponsor for today's video ownersaver.com they have some of the most realistic and high quality lightsabers on the market and right now when you purchase a lightsaber you can get a free Scabbard with your purchase for free simply add both the Scabbard and the lightsaber to the cart and use the code Tech t-e-c-k all caps at checkout ownersaver.com also has a super sale category where two Savers from each one of their collections are given a huge discount these Sabers are unfortunately not involved in the free Scabbard special also the dark cyber does not fit into the Scabbard I tried this special ends on September 24th so take advantage of it now check out the description down below for more information and don't forget to use our promo code Ewok for an additional 15 off of your purchase thank you for your patience on to the rest of the video the nomenclature night Trooper clearly refers to the death Mary they like to call themselves night sisters and night brothers and so these guys are the night Troopers these night Troopers are wrapped up in Red Ribbon which clearly means that they are wrapped up in death Mary magic and this kind of makes sense thrawn was Spirited Away to this planet of Purity Homeworld of the deaf Mary and he's this very analytical individual who's really good at first Contact situations thrawn loves studying new cultures and arts this gives them a better understanding of how a new group he encounters will act and whether they're going to threaten him or be a potential ally honestly get the vibe that thrawn might be on the Spectrum but since he's a genius he's shored up his social abilities by turning the art of understanding other people into almost science he's a fascinating character more importantly he's done a very emotionally driven individual and so he lands on this planet of paridia with his Fleet completely destroyed aside from the Chimera as far as we can see he needs to figure out how to keep himself and his troops alive or at least you know active and going I don't know a live qualifies here you know Ultron used to care a lot about his subordinates and make sure that they were all taken care of and constantly being challenged in order to promote growth now thrawn back in those days was in a much more relaxed situation when he served the empire was it was before the battle of the oven had even happened so the empire was still intact there were plenty of resources plenty of time for thrawn to train his men properly but getting gated to another galaxy with no hope of coming back well that changes a person it makes them more desperate and thrawn being the rational individual that he is was pragmatic here he looked at the dathmary Knight sisters and saw them as a very valuable Ally on this Wasteland of a planet and I have to give him credit for this in all honesty I would have screamed witch and then ordered my weapons officer to open fire on them the second I saw them they're absolutely terrifying I mean you don't wear red in an environment this Stark unless you're a complete badass and capable of [ __ ] up everything in the surrounding area but what is interesting is these witches actually seem to respect thrawn back Brothers I salute you I mean typically Mystics and Hyper rational military types don't really get along well together but they do have a common goal you see both thrawn and the Knight sisters seem to want to leave peridia desperately we don't exactly know why the nicesters want to leave this being their home planet we'll speculate about that more in later videos but anyway thrawn cuts a deal with them soon we should all escape this Exile thanks to the efforts of Morgan house path captain of my God he shall begin the cargo transfer as per my agreement with the great mothers I have seen the catacombs it will take some time so the night sisters are having thrawn basically empty out their catacomba catacomb is an underground cemetery and thrawn is having his captain Enoch named after the biblical patriarch of the same name bring all of these I'm guessing corpses onto his ship the doth Mary are known for their dark magic they have the ability to reanimate corpses fortify an individual signs and strength with magical icker they can even create legs out of thin air as mother talson did for Maul I I believe that the dark magic the night sisters are using here is somehow related to Sith Alchemy this is an ancient Force technique that was lost in the various Jedi versus Sith Wars that have basically destroyed all of the force knowledge in the galaxy in the last few thousand years Darth cities and Darth Plagueis really try to revive Sith Alchemy and Insidious actually tries to partner with Mother Towson early on in his role in order to learn more of her Secrets but he does betray her and that partnership kind of ends but yeah my sisters are pretty powerful they have a different way of manipulating the force something that's lost in the um I guess you could call it the Star Wars Galaxy because this is another galaxy and it seems like in isolation I'm pretty these great mothers have managed to keep this tradition of Sith Alchemy alive and I believe what we're seeing here with these night Troopers is heavily related to their dark magic magic that thrawn has no fear of because again he's this practical individual he just wants to survive great mothers I should once again require the aid of your dark magic the thread of Destiny demands it Grand Admiral now based just on the appearances of these night Troopers with their cracks in their helmet all the dirt and Grime on their bodies a lot of people have said that they kind of remind them of death Troopers because I've never read death Troopers let me just say it's not only a great Star Wars zombie novel it's just a great zombie novel period This Book is usually in my top five when people are asking me for recommendations of Star Wars reads this novel is basically self-contained so you don't have to read anything else it's just a really great story I like it a lot but that was a zombie epidemic created by a virus a force virus of sorts and I actually don't think that's what we're seeing here I listened to the voices of these night Troopers once again and they kind of sounds a lot like Merrick The Inquisitor who kind of explodes into a dust cloud they kind of sound more like the urakai here than just a legion of dead and the movement of these night Troopers isn't very stiff or Eerie like you would expect from a zombie trooper I mean look at these Undead death Mary zombies they just don't act or move in the same way these Troopers seem more calm and disciplined they seem to move in very natural and fluid ways if thrawn is using an undead Army I think that's what's hidden inside of the Catacombs you know generations and generations of night sisters buried perfectly just waiting to be revived I also kind of hate this idea that thrawn would actually use black magic to turn all of his Troopers into Undead minions I mean clearly a lot of Stormtroopers survive the transit to paridia or at least I think they did I mean the windows were breached in some areas but this is a large large ship more importantly if thrawn has to convert a few Stormtroopers into the undead I'm sure the other Stormtroopers would get really pissed off and he would have to basically make them all zombies it's either all of them or none of of them a part of me wants to really think that these Stormtroopers are just decorating you know they're embracing the local culture they like the red ribbons well we all know that thrawn Stormtroopers are supposed to be highly trained and very disciplined not in an irrational way but like you know they're supposed to keep their uniforms clean at least it's all a part of this image this this routine that soldiers have to keep up in order to be always prepared it's just kind of confusing seeing thrawn commanding such a rabble it's not that thrawn would refuse to lead a unit because of such superficial reasons but the stormtrooper's appearance is supposed to reflect their Commander's Clarity of mind and and his you know just professionalism in my opinion there has to be a reason why these Stormtroopers look like this when they're so dirty and so again the other side of the argument here that the night Troopers are in fact creatures of the night awoken from their Eternal sleep is getting stronger you know what thrawn does encounter on this planet is a shortage of hyper matter of fuel shortage of proton torpedoes and more importantly a shortage of food and water a star destroy usually has tens of thousands of crew on board including a legion of Stormtroopers the average ISD is like a small City and they have warehouses full of Provisions but those Provisions usually only last two years according to the brochures thrawn's ship has been stuck on this planet for 10 11 years now and so they must have ran out of their provisions and there doesn't seem to be that much food on the surface either also the fact that we don't see any unhelmeted Personnel you know like Imperial Navy officers or Troopers it's kind of troubling these Star Destroyers should have far more Navy crew than Stormtroopers they usually outnumber them three to one and the fact that his right hand man is no longer a naval Aid or a captain is a troubling sign the Imperial Navy has always been at odds with the Stormtrooper core we've done videos about this but basically the Stormtrooper core is a little bit more basic in how they think they're about ground pounding kicking down doors which is useful but the Imperial Navy they're recruited from the smarter segments of society who have to make it through the Imperial Academy score very high and then make it to flight school so they're naturally going to be more independent minded and going to resist things like I don't know being turned into Undead zombies I feel like the fact that thrawn has a stormtrooper Captain right he's always had Imperial Navy attaches and you know officers by his side to help him but but a stormtrooper second in command means thrawn has probably become a little more fanatic a little more reliant on heavy-handed measures it's possible that these Stormtroopers and the Navy Troopers had a fight on board I don't know just some theories here and so now all you have left is Enoch The Shepherd of all these dead bodies and what's with the gold mask us well that's always been a part of thrawn's motif he's always had gold decorating his stuff and gold is the color of wisdom elegance and Divinity it's also one of the densest materials in the world it's very durable it's an excellent conductor of energy and it doesn't rust it really does stand out on all that dirty white planetary armor gold is also commonly used in alchemy and Witchcraft because of its amazing properties and what's even more interesting is Enoch with his golden mask is replicating an old Roman tradition the funerary mask you know Romans weren't a very culturally rich people originally they were warriors a soldiering culture they were really good at Logistics and fighting and organizing their military and really a lot of their culture and art comes from absorbing other cultures that have Arts but the funeral mask has always been a deeply rooted Roman thing I guess as soldiers they've always been obsessed with death and so these masks are designed to be a legacy Monument to the person whose likeness it's made out of as a matter of fact it wasn't uncommon for entire families to wear masks of the deceased to show their importance it should be noted that some Elite Roman Cavalry units did have golden masks as well as a part of their attire it was usually used for more dangerous training it's a sign of strength also on the battlefield but again it was rare for soldiers to actually wear this into battle because it really limits your field of view but yeah I still think this is a funerary mask on Enoch which kind of is another point for this Undead Army Theory Grand Admiral mercenaries have Departed it does sound like Merrick a lot when he talks and Merrick wasn't really that solid of a character when Ahsoka penetrated his suit and so maybe we're looking at a similar application of magic here maybe the bodies are gone inside of these Stormtrooper outfits and now the nice sisters have used their ancient magic to animate these suits using the PlanetSide and rubber insulation suits as a seal for the spirits and the red ribbons that are wrapped around it on the outside are sort of like a charm or a ribbon that keeps the spirits tethered inside the gold plate in the metal might be another type of totem that keeps these Spirits inside of these Stormtrooper uniforms remember we talked about this holy and divine meaning behind gold it should also be noted that Enoch doesn't have any red ribbons on him which makes him a bit different from the other Troopers it might indicate that he's not under the spell the grandmothers which is why thrawn has him as a second in command but then again uh you know Enoch says the followingness of being Ren when she leaves die well it's almost a little too on the nose maybe thrawn's people ran out of food maybe a lot of these Stormtroopers died on the ship when the Pergo started damaging the ship inventing compartments into space maybe as I mentioned before the Stormtroopers and the naval Troopers had a mutiny and started fighting against each other star trooper helmets don't just crack in half like that unless blunt force is applied to the plastoid now there could be a third option which is kind of like night sister magic light which is where they use their magical acre to imbue these Stormtroopers with Supernatural Powers whatever those might be just like how mother talza made savagio press far stronger and more powerful than he actually was with the magical liquor this is kind of a nice half measure it would still explain all those red ribbons wrapped around the Troopers and maybe the metal that's on their armor is just an attempt to repair these things with local materials I mean creating plastoid is probably really difficult if you don't have the right tools and materials which they definitely don't have but if you use old blacksmithing technology you can work gold or iron into something usable whatever it is there is something clearly wrong with this planet a Decay or sense of dread that the force users particularly feel you know after talking through everything I'm starting to believe in this whole theory that this indeed is a spirit arming or an army of the undead I mean we really won't be able to tell until Ahsoka or Sabine or Ezra starts whacking these Stormtroopers in the head and like you know dust comes out of them or something I wonder if you get sick if you inhale that green dust it cannot be good for you anyway I do want to end this video by talking about thrawn I think we're seeing a character who's holding it together quite well on the surface but if you read the Canon novels of this character you'll know that he's fallen really a long way from what he used to be a more a bright-eyed individual who really wanted peace and stability for the Galaxy who kind of joined up with the wrong side in my opinion and now he's basically really committed to this Imperial lie of strength peace through strength you know the order and stability that the Amber I promised to bring to the Galaxy was always an illusion it's clear that the Old Republic even the new Republic was far more efficient in spreading resources and improving the lives of the people living underneath its role if anything balbodin's policies thrawn's own actions caused more chaos than peace and so thrawn being where he is in life is probably now not above using whatever means necessary to not only survive but get his revenge in the past and legends he wasn't above using the sparta clone cylinders to create an army he wasn't he might not have understood what the force was but he wasn't above using the force to his Advantage so seeing Granite will thrawn at the head of an army of Undead dakamari night Troopers is just not the wildest thing in the world well guys let me know in the comments section below which you think as always I

Catch the full streams & videos here: https://www.youtube.com/battlefrontupdates",episode 6 of Ahsoka was fantastic and there was so much Incredible World building with the two galaxies with thrawn and Knight sisters finally in live action and they just all looked and sounded amazing the night sisters had this ghostly look and even the double Echo voice that we hear in the Clone Wars and then thrown absolute perfection Lars Mickelson obviously did a fantastic job in Rebels and he definitely mirrored that here which I am so happy to see but I'm really interested in his Troopers which if you have subtitles on are actually called night Troopers which makes me think that all of these Troopers with the red the kind of bandages seemingly patching together their armor could very well be reanimated dead Stormtroopers powered by night sister magic or even if they are normal humans they could just be Juiced up on night sister magic a bit like how marook was eNook the guy with the golden face which is thrawn's captain of the Guard I had a bit of a different voice when we heard him speak I think that's more due to to the helmet being modified and it's not just a classic Stormtrooper sound and not him being reanimated because all the reanimated Troopers we've seen in the past or reanimated night sisters they've been more zombie-like and not necessarily been able to talk and act humanly like it seems like Eno can do here so I think the red stripes around the night Troopers is either just a symbol to show their partnership together with the Knight sisters or their actual like zombie Troopers under Thrones command and that the people who did survive might be having more important positions like you know flying the ship being mechanics and things like that and keeping the reanimated Troopers as just Cannon father that's just my guess they could all just be human and this is just purely an aesthetic thing but since thrawn mentions that he needs the help of the Knight sisters dark magic again it definitely makes me think the Troopers are affected in some way but what do you guys think

#shorts #StarWars #StarWarsOutlaws",just a warning once you say this you're probably not going to be able to unsee it but don't you think in the new Ahsoka trailer Grand Admiral thrawn who's played by Lars Mickelson looks like a blue Elon Musk the resemblance is uncanny man it's the same character it's the same it's him Elon didn't tell us he was going to be playing this character making a cameo in hisoka series I'm really curious if it's just this angle that he looks kind of like this or I mean I guess Lars Mickelson and Elon look a bit similar right but when you make him blue it just totally sells it for me what do you think

#TED #TEDTalks #education #AI #khanacademy","So anyone who's been paying attention
for the last few months has been seeing headlines like this, especially in education. The thesis has been: students are going to be using ChatGPT
and other forms of AI to cheat, do their assignments. They’re not going to learn. And it’s going to completely undermine
education as we know it. Now, what I'm going to argue today is not only are there ways
to mitigate all of that, if we put the right guardrails,
we do the right things, we can mitigate it. But I think we're at the cusp of using AI for probably the biggest
positive transformation that education has ever seen. And the way we're going to do that is by giving every student on the planet an artificially intelligent
but amazing personal tutor. And we're going to give every teacher
on the planet an amazing, artificially intelligent
teaching assistant. And just to appreciate
how big of a deal it would be to give everyone a personal tutor, I show you this clip from Benjamin Bloom’s 1984
2 sigma study, or he called it the “2 sigma problem.” The 2 sigma comes
from two standard deviation, sigma, the symbol for standard deviation. And he had good data that showed
that look, a normal distribution, that's the one that you see
in the traditional bell curve right in the middle, that's how the world
kind of sorts itself out, that if you were to give personal
1-to-1 to tutoring for students, then you could actually get a distribution
that looks like that right. It says tutorial 1-to-1
with the asterisks, like, that right distribution, a two standard-deviation improvement. Just to put that in plain language, that could take your average student
and turn them into an exceptional student. It can take your below-average student and turn them into
an above-average student. Now the reason why he framed it
as a problem, was he said, well, this is all good, but how do you actually scale
group instruction this way? How do you actually give it
to everyone in an economic way? What I'm about to show you is I think
the first moves towards doing that. Obviously, we've been trying
to approximate it in some way at Khan Academy for over a decade now, but I think we're at the cusp
of accelerating it dramatically. I'm going to show you
the early stages of what our AI, which we call Khanmigo, what it can now do and maybe a little bit
of where it is actually going. So this right over here
is a traditional exercise that you or many of your children
might have seen on Khan Academy. But what's new is that little
bot thing at the right. And we'll start by seeing one
of the very important safeguards, which is the conversation is recorded
and viewable by your teacher. It’s moderated actually by a second AI. And also it does not tell you the answer. It is not a cheating tool. When the student says,
""Tell me the answer,"" it says, ""I'm your tutor. What do you think is the next step
for solving the problem?"" Now, if the student makes a mistake,
and this will surprise people who think large language models
are not good at mathematics, notice, not only does it
notice the mistake, it asks the student to explain
their reasoning, but it's actually doing what I would say, not just even an average tutor would do,
but an excellent tutor would do. It’s able to divine what is probably
the misconception in that student’s mind, that they probably didn’t use
the distributive property. Remember, we need to distribute
the negative two to both the nine and the 2m
inside of the parentheses. This to me is a very, very, very big deal. And it's not just in math. This is a computer programming
exercise on Khan Academy, where the student needs
to make the clouds part. And so we can see the student starts
defining a variable, left X minus minus. It only made the left cloud part. But then they can ask Khanmigo,
what’s going on? Why is only the left cloud moving? And it understands the code. It knows all the context
of what the student is doing, and it understands that those ellipses
are there to draw clouds, which I think is kind of mind-blowing. And it says, ""To make the right
cloud move as well, try adding a line of code
inside the draw function that increments the right X variable
by one pixel in each frame."" Now, this one is maybe even more amazing
because we have a lot of math teachers. We've all been trying to teach
the world to code, but there aren't a lot of computing
teachers out there. And what you just saw,
even when I'm tutoring my kids, when they're learning to code, I can't help them this well, this fast, this is really going to be a super tutor. And it's not just exercises. It understands what you're watching. It understands the context of your video. It can answer the age-old question,
“Why do I need to learn this?” And it asks Socratically,
""Well, what do you care about?"" And let's say the student says,
""I want to be a professional athlete."" And it says, ""Well, learning
about the size of cells, which is what this video is, that could be really useful
for understanding nutrition and how your body works, etc."" It can answer questions, it can quiz you, it can connect it to other ideas, you can now ask
as many questions of a video as you could ever dream of. (Applause) Another big shortage out there, I remember the high school I went to, the student-to-guidance counselor ratio
was about 200 or 300 to one. A lot of the country,
it's worse than that. We can use Khanmigo to give
every student a guidance counselor, academic coach, career coach, life coach, which is exactly
what you see right over here. And we launched this
with the GPT-4 launch. We have a few thousand people on this. This isn't a fake demo, this is really it in action. And then there is, you know, things that I think it would
have been even harder, it would have been a little
science fiction to do with even a traditional tutor. We run an online high school
with Arizona State University called Khan World School, and we have a student who attends
that online school, based in India. Her name's Saanvi. And she was doing a report
on ""The Great Gatsby."" And when she was reading
""The Great Gatsby,"" Jay Gatsby keeps looking
at the green light off into the distance. And she's like, ""Why does he do that?"" She did some web searches,
and people have obviously studied this and commented about the symbolism of that, but none of it was really
resonating with her. And then she realized
that she had Khanmigo and that she could talk
to Jay Gatsby himself. And so, ""Ah, splendid choice, old sport. I am now Jay Gatsby,
the enigmatic millionaire from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic.” And so, ""Why do you keep staring
at the green light?"" ""Ah, the green light, old sport. It's a symbol of my dreams
and desires, you see. It's situated at the end
of Daisy Buchanan's dock across the bay from my mansion. I gaze at it longingly
as it represents my yearning for the past and my hope to reunite with Daisy,
the love of my life."" And what was cool is, Saanvi then said,
“I had this long conversation,” she called him “Mr. Gatsby,” and at the end she actually apologized
for taking his time, which I thought was very polite of her. But you can imagine this unlocks
learning literature, learning ... You could talk to historical figures. We're even probably
going to add an activity you can talk to like,
the Mississippi River. It brings things to life in ways
that really were science fiction even six months or a year ago. Students can get into debates with the AI. And we’ve got this here
is the student debating whether we should cancel student debt. The student is against
canceling student debt, and we've gotten very clear feedback. We started running it at Khan World School
in our lab school that we have, Khan Lab School. The students, the high school
students especially, they're saying ""This is amazing to be able
to fine-tune my arguments without fearing judgment. It makes me that much more confident to go into the classroom
and really participate."" And we all know that Socratic dialogue
debate is a great way to learn, but frankly, it's not out there
for most students. But now it can be accessible
to hopefully everyone. A lot of the narrative,
we saw that in the headlines, has been, ""It's going to do the writing for kids. Kids are not going to learn to write."" But we are showing that there's ways
that the AI doesn't write for you, it writes with you. So this is a little thing, and my eight year old is addicted to this, and he's not a kid
that really liked writing before, but you can say, “I want to write a horror story,” and it says, ""Ooh, a horror story,
how spine-tingling and thrilling. Let's dive into the world of eerie shadows
and chilling mysteries."" And this is an activity where
the student will write two sentences, and then the AI will write two sentences. And so they collaborate
together on a story. The student writes,
""Beatrice was a misunderstood ghost. She wanted to make friends
but kept scaring them by accident."" And the AI says, ""Poor Beatrice, a lonely
spirit yearning for companionship. One day she stumbled
upon an old abandoned mansion,"" etc. I encourage you all
to hopefully one day try this. This is surprisingly fun. Now to even more directly
hit this use case. And what I'm about to show you, everything I showed you so far is actually already part of Khanmigo,
and what I’m about to show you, we haven't shown to anyone yet,
this is a prototype. We hope to be able to launch it
in the next few months, but this is to directly use AI,
use generative AI, to not undermine English
and language arts but to actually enhance it in ways that we couldn't have even
conceived of even a year ago. This is reading comprehension. The students reading Steve Jobs's
famous speech at Stanford. And then as they get to certain points, they can click on that little question. And the AI will then Socratically,
almost like an oral exam, ask the student about things. And the AI can highlight
parts of the passage. Why did the author use that word? What was their intent? Does it back up their argument? They can start to do stuff
that once again, we never had the capability
to give everyone a tutor, everyone a writing coach to actually
dig in to reading at this level. And you could go on the other side of it. And we have whole work flows
that helps them write, helps them be a writing coach,
draw an outline. But once a student actually
constructs a draft, and this is where
they're constructing a draft, they can ask for feedback once again, as you would expect
from a good writing coach. In this case, the student
will say, let's say, ""Does my evidence support my claim?"" And then the AI, not only
is able to give feedback, but it's able to highlight certain parts
of the passage and says, ""On this passage, this doesn't
quite support your claim,"" but once again, Socratically says,
""Can you tell us why?"" So it's pulling the student,
making them a better writer, giving them far more feedback than they've ever been able
to actually get before. And we think this is going to dramatically
accelerate writing, not hurt it. Now, everything I've talked
about so far is for the student. But we think this could be equally
as powerful for the teacher to drive more personalized
education and frankly save time and energy for themselves
and for their students. So this is an American history
exercise on Khan Academy. It's a question
about the Spanish-American War. And at first it's in student mode. And if you say, “Tell me the answer,”
it’s not going to tell the answer. It's going to go into tutoring mode. But that little toggle
which teachers have access to, they can turn student mode off
and then it goes into teacher mode. And what this does is it turns into -- You could view it
as a teacher's guide on steroids. Not only can it explain the answer, it can explain how you might
want to teach it. It can help prepare
the teacher for that material. It can help them create lesson plans,
as you could see doing right there. It'll eventually help them
create progress reports and help them, eventually, grade. So once again, teachers spend
about half their time with this type of activity,
lesson planning. All of that energy can go back to them or go back to human interactions
with their actual students. (Applause) So, you know, one point I want to make. These large language models
are so powerful, there's a temptation to say like, well, all these people are just going
to slap them onto their websites, and it kind of turns the applications
themselves into commodities. And what I've got to tell you is that’s one of the reasons
why I didn’t sleep for two weeks when I first had access
to GPT-4 back in August. But we quickly realized
that to actually make it magical, I think what you saw
with Khanmigo a little bit, it didn't interact with you
the way that you see ChatGPT interacting. It was a little bit more magical,
it was more Socratic, it was clearly much better at math than what most people
are used to thinking. And the reason is, there was a lot of work
behind the scenes to make that happen. And I could go through the whole list
of everything we've been working on, many, many people for over six,
seven months to make it feel magical. But perhaps the most
intellectually interesting one is we realized, and this was an idea
from an OpenAI researcher, that we could dramatically improve
its ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think
before it speaks. So if you're tutoring someone and you immediately just start talking
before you assess their math, you might not get it right. But if you construct
thoughts for yourself, and what you see on the right
there is an actual AI thought, something that it generates for itself
but it does not share with the student. then its accuracy went up dramatically, and its ability to be a world-class tutor
went up dramatically. And you can see it's talking
to itself here. It says, ""The student got a different
answer than I did, but do not tell them they made a mistake. Instead, ask them to explain
how they got to that step."" So I'll just finish off, hopefully, you know, what I’ve just shown you
is just half of what we are working on, and we think this is just
the very tip of the iceberg of where this can actually go. And I'm pretty convinced, which I wouldn't
have been even a year ago, that we together have a chance
of addressing the 2 sigma problem and turning it into a 2 sigma opportunity, dramatically accelerating
education as we know it. Now, just to take a step back
at a meta level, obviously we heard a lot today,
the debates on either side. There's folks who take
a more pessimistic view of AI, they say this is scary, there's all these dystopian scenarios, we maybe want to slow down,
we want to pause. On the other side,
there are the more optimistic folks that say, well, we've gone
through inflection points before, we've gone through
the Industrial Revolution. It was scary, but it all
kind of worked out. And what I'd argue right now is I don't think this is like
a flip of a coin or this is something
where we'll just have to, like, wait and see which way it turns out. I think everyone here and beyond, we are active participants
in this decision. I'm pretty convinced
that the first line of reasoning is actually almost
a self-fulfilling prophecy, that if we act with fear and if we say, ""Hey, we've just got to stop
doing this stuff,"" what's really going to happen
is the rule followers might pause, might slow down, but the rule breakers,
as Alexandr [Wang] mentioned, the totalitarian governments,
the criminal organizations, they're only going to accelerate. And that leads to what I am pretty
convinced is the dystopian state, which is the good actors
have worse AIs than the bad actors. But I'll also, you know,
talk to the optimists a little bit. I don't think that means that, oh, yeah, then we should just relax
and just hope for the best. That might not happen either. I think all of us together
have to fight like hell to make sure that we put the guardrails, we put in -- when the problems arise -- reasonable regulations. But we fight like hell
for the positive use cases. Because very close to my heart, and obviously there's many
potential positive use cases, but perhaps the most powerful use case and perhaps the most poetic use case
is if AI, artificial intelligence, can be used to enhance HI,
human intelligence, human potential and human purpose. Thank you. (Applause) "

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",the Clone trip is one of the most prominent and numerous characters in the Star Wars Galaxy and have had such a major impact on the Star Wars timeline today I'm going to show you every single time the clone troopers have appeared in live action and what's funny about that is that most of the time they've been CGI 45 minutes into the attack of clones we get to see the clones for the very first time in live action when Obi-Wan is visiting kamino first we see the infant clones played by Daniel Logan who also plays Boba Fett in his childhood years and then we get to see clones that are a little older seemingly in their early 20s played by Bodie Taylor who also shows up in Avengers Sith for this scene the actor recalls having to sit and be filmed individually numerous times eating from multiple angles I had to actually get filmed um individually each sequence so it took about 101 shots and I do eat uh tofu bro it was a tofu then the rest of the Clones in this sequence training in the background and putting on their helmets are all CGI which is a trend that's going to continue here afterwards Obi-Wan meets Jango Fett and we get our first look in live action at the original template for the Clones played by tomorrow Morrison I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe and after this we don't actually see the Clones again until the arena on Geonosis where Yoda comes in leading the Clone Army in full force to rescue the Jedi the Clones play a major part for the rest of the film showing their full arsenal and capabilities as the Grand Army of the Republic but the entirety of the Clone Army for the rest of this film is CGI that includes the pilots that includes this clone with Padme the animators the ones who provided the motion capture for the soldiers which were then converted into CGI and since not a single one of them takes their helmet off the rest of the scene tomorrow Morrison only provides his voice for the dialogue final moments of episode 2 show the Clone Army in its entirety getting ready to go to war possibly one of the grandest largest shots in all the prequels one of the most iconic and this entire thing is computer generated episode 3 presents more clones in action within the first few minutes of the film we see Anakin and Obi-Wan on their way to the Invisible Hand General grieve is a ship being escorted by a squadron of arc-170 Clone Fighters around your tail General Kenobi tomorrow Morrison plays the leader of the Squadron Oddball who also appeared in the Clone Wars series thank you sir sorry I panicked and plays an unnamed clone pilot who dies during the battle also Bodie Taylor makes a cameo as a young unnamed pilot who gets killed by Droid star Fighters after that clones show up on screen very briefly when the Invisible Hand conducts a naval engagement on a republic Cruiser and then later on when Obi-Wan and Windu are taking Yoda to meet with the walkies in both instances they're all CGI then it's time to see them in action again when Republic forces arrive on kashyyk to assist the wookies against the droid army their CGI in these scenes and all dialogue here is voiced by tomorrow Morrison the droids have started up their main power generators now when Obi-Wan takes off to go capture General Grievous most of the Clones of the briefing are CGI except for a Commander Cody who's also known for being in the Clone Wars series his body is clearly CGI while tomorrow Morrison's head was placed on top of Cody's body and also the two Troopers nearby there's also a younger clone next to Cody when Obi-Wan gets into his Starfighter come on when have I ever let you down the movie then takes a small break from the battlefield until Obi-Wan confronts Grievous and the entire Republic army raids the separatist hideout then the moment we've all been waiting for the Clones Carry Out Darth sidious's orders to kill the Jedi Execute Order 66. clones attacked the Jedi at the temple and all throughout the Galaxy executing Order 66 without hesitation [Music] all the clones from this point forward even the ones that confront George Lucas's son yes that's him there and then kill George Lucas's son our CGI which is really impressive when you look at them I think I'm sorry sir it's time for you to leave and after Order 66 the Clones are portrayed with a different demeanor more specifically in their voice sir no one could have survived that ball stop loading your man on the ship the scenes where they were searching for Yoda and Obi-Wan shows how they've switched after Sidious gave the order to portray the Jedi a little bit of a darker more Sinister menacing tone move to the east after Palpatine's door with Yoda we get our first look at these shock troopers appearing for the first time in live action and then the Clones go on to have their final appearance on screen in Revenge the Sith when Darth Sidious goes to rescue his Apprentice on Mustafar they briefly appear escorting Palpatine to the Grand Republic medical facility so up until this point mostly all clones in the movies are CGI with only the exception of Tomorrow Morrison's face showing up when he plays Cody and also the arc-170 pilots also for these movies apparently George Lucas decided to use ex-military professionals to provide motion capture for clones combat moves which I think is why they look so professional and before we get on to the live action clones and other appearances of Clone Troopers I want to talk a little bit about why George Lucas actually decided to make all the Clones CGI because he chose this for a specific reason the main reason was because every clone was supposed to be the same it would be difficult to cast several individuals that were all the same height and size to form a line of Clone Troopers completely identical in every detail to have armor fitted for every single one of these and make them all look the same would have been a huge pain I think it was just a lot simpler to make them CGI and also actors actually wearing clone armor would have made a lot of the stunts the Clones do a lot harder to actually perform borderline impossible you think you can actually do a combat roll wearing that stuff gonna break apart not a good day so I think it's likely that up until this point the decision to make all the Clones computer animated was more practical than anything else and for several years Beyond this point the Clones would only exist in animation with the Clone Wars series and the bad batch until 2022 when grogu in the book of Boba Fett gets a flashback to the night he survived Order 66 and here the Clones once again seem to be computer generated and they barely have any dialogue it wasn't until a few months later also in 2022 when Obi-Wan Kenobi released premiering the first ever live-action clone troopers in real armor when the Clone stormed the Jedi Temple in an attempt to kill a group of younglings that managed to escape an episode later Obi-Wan would meet an old 501st clone trooper begging for money in the streets of and this tragic scene I think goes such a long way as it shows how The Empire abandoned them and left all surviving clones to wander the Galaxy with no real purpose and nowhere to go in Mandalorian season 3 grogu has another flashback where he remembers escaping the temple thanks to Jedi Master Keller and back [Music] clones Chase kelleran and grow grew through crew sign and even blast through a building until they lose the Jedi Master in grogu the Clones here were also played by real people you can actually see photos of them behind the scenes it's really cool to see them all together and obviously you can kind of notice height differences and slight variations in the armor but just seeing them in live action seeing how shining the armor I think is really impressive after this it wasn't until Ahsoka episode 5 where we got to see the Clones again in live action but this time not only phase two clone troopers and not only during Order 66 we get to see clones in Phase One armor running through the Battle of ryloth led by Anakin Skywalker a bit later we get an emotional scene with Ahsoka resting our hand on a severely injured clone trooper with his face covered while Anakin is talking to Captain Rex also the first appearance of Captain racks in live action wearing his real armor shortly after this we also get to see the 332nd company with your soccer inspired paint job during the siege of Mandalore Rex orders his man to secure the perimeter and his last scene leading his men into battle come on let's let's go you also notice that in the Ahsoka series we don't really see clones together they seem to maintain a bit of distance between each other likely to not show the high differences and slight differences in their armor there's a couple instances where they're standing closer together these are likely actors who had a similar build and that's every time clone troopers have appeared in live action let me know if you know of other times and thanks for watching this my name is Andrew I'll catch you soon 
264,5JRMaP4RSGE,2023-04-11T02:00:01Z,Dave Filoni on Directing His First STAR WARS Movie (Exclusive),Dave Filoni spoke with ET's Ash Crossan at Star Wars Celebration Europe after Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy announced Filoni would helm his first live-action 'Star Wars' movie.,okay I had some predict I had some predictions I told you on Friday I said Mary Elizabeth Winstead is playing you did but I didn't say anything you didn't you were like interesting which I always means the nose which I go I'm right there you go my other prediction that I didn't say to your face was that we're getting a Dave filoni Star Wars movie announcement I swear to God it'll be weird what if you're wrong but I would have appreciated the thought and said that's so nice if you thank you for the thought that's okay it's so long overdue so great I can't wait um how are you feeling feel good you know jet lagged but otherwise really good it's surreal you know I think it just you know for all the talk we've had about it it really just hit me yesterday when we were rehearsing and I was up on stage uh with everyone I'm like all right this is really happening yeah this is going to be out there I have a lot of work to do it's surreal experience and uh you know I appreciate people's enthusiasm around it and uh I would dedicate myself to doing the best job I can that's for sure during the panel there was like a click moment for me where it was like we see Monmouth show up in the Ahsoka trailer we saw some footage for the Mandalorian where a certain person is mentioned at the beginning and it's like all the pieces are coming together and I believe culminating in your film that would seem dare I say logical you know that would be logical I mean this is the first day so you don't want to make too many presumptions there's a panel tomorrow probably want to check that out there might be some news tomorrow I don't know but you think it's the whole weekend of this we can't just put it all in one day we've got to spread some things out right so there's be dated by tomorrow because we saw the back of thrawn's head I'm like who is it why did you why did you just why do I think that yeah why would you think that I mean you gotta you gotta might not be what if it's not though that could be like what you just said now could be like if you said I'm making a movie and I'm not what if it wasn't you know it could it could be something different it could be some other character entirely it could be I'm just saying that's a possibility it's not necessarily true would it yeah kind of kind of interesting interesting interesting there's a moment that I like I think like teared up a little bit when we have these three pictures and it was Ahsoka Sabine and Hera what was that moment like for you I guess and seeing them all on set together too that moment was like I'm so glad we've explained who Mary's playing so happy that's out because she's awesome and she did a great job so I'm really happy for her um it's it's weird right those characters it's not like they're more real now to me they were always real but I'm glad we have such great people playing them I'm glad that people want to see this story I'm glad that people cheered and are excited about it I mean it's I don't know if you really can understand it all when you're there writing it and and making it it's it's just different um but yeah I look up and I see those characters when they get up there they are it just it kind of makes sense I guess it's a weird way to say it I'm just glad people you know still seem to want it because I sure like them and I've been looking forward to telling this story if I were to tell 2005 Dave who just started you're going to be directing a Star Wars movie what would you say oh you're crazy yeah I mean I wasn't I had so much to learn about what I was doing in animation you I had a long way to go um it's really you know George committing to teaching not just me but the entire animation team uh how to tell a better story and how to use the tools but you know he's the one that kind of got me interested in even thinking about live action as a possibility of something I might might like to do because of the tools he provided us an animation because of the way we shot the Clone Wars differently we didn't do traditional storyboarding we didn't do and we did more of a virtual camera system much more akin to what John was doing later in uh Jungle Book so I was learning these tools things this way of thinking and it started to click over time is I would sit literally for hours and watch him edit take things that we had taught in animation and he would edit them and make them in something new and change the story and I had no ambition to write anything prior to working on Clone Wars was George but George was insistent that if I'm going to be a direct drive to learn how to write and so I started writing episodes of homers because of that so it's really been an evolution all along the way and just you're surrounded by great people you know hopefully you can learn and and do better but the it's the biggest thing I talk to young people about it's like sometimes you're in these positions you don't have to say anything you have to listen to the people that know more than you and absorb and so I mean the look I'm surrounded by now just the the other directors uh creative Talent there I'm still learning all the time and then you just gotta apply when the moment is right so the moment's coming and I'm gonna apply hopefully I already am on Ahsoka foreign 
265,ELxykoy4NTM,2023-04-08T00:07:18Z,"Dave Filoni Star Wars Movie Announced, New Sequel Movie Confirmed - IGN The Fix: Entertainment","We’ve got a ton of Star Wars news to break down, with new details emerging on new entries into the franchise that’s not too far, far away. Starting with both Dave Filoni and James Mangold set to direct two separate upcoming Star Wars films. Detailing what we can expect further from each director, Filoni’s movie will apparently close out the New Republic, tying up the stories told within the Disney Plus shows, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and the upcoming Ahsoka series. For Filoni, this’ll be a great way for the interconnected stories we’ve seen play out on the Disney Plus live-action offerings with Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, and soon Ashoka, to tie up any loose ends left on the small screen, and potentially bring these characters together for a galactic battle fit for theaters. That’s a tall order, but if anyone’s up to the task, it’s Dave Filoni, who was a protegé of George Lucas’ prior to the Disney era of #StarWars. And finally, John Leguzamo has no plans to see the Super Mario Bros. movie.

#IGN #StarWars",what's up everybody I'm Akeem Lawson and in today's fix of entertainment news what to expect from Dave filoni Star Wars movie the next three sets of films in the storied Star Wars franchise plus updates and trailers for upcoming Star Wars shows to Disney plus and Leguizamo is protesting the new Mario movie and why you should too I'm just kidding we're all gonna go see it no matter what he says let's drop it [Music] laughs right now Star Wars fans celebrate like literally it's Star Wars celebration happening in London all week long and we've got a ton of Star Wars news to break down with new details emerging on new entries into the franchise that's not too far far away starting with both Dave filoni and James Mangold set to direct two separate upcoming Star Wars films now detail of what we can expect further from each director filoni's movie will apparently close out the new Republic tying up the stories told within the Disney Plus shows the Mandalorian the book of Boba Fett and the upcoming Ahsoka series now this is great news for Star Wars fans as felony has been behind some of the franchise's most beloved recent entries expanding the Galaxy first in animated form with the Clone Wars and Rebels before breaking into live action with the Mandalorian which he co-created with John favaro as for James mangold's movie it'll be set during the dawn of the Jedi so tens of thousands of years before any of the other Star Wars movies or shows now for filoni this will be a great way for the interconnected stories we've seen play out on the Disney plus live action offerings with Mandalorian book of Boba Fett and soon Ahsoka to tie up any loose ends left on the small screen and potentially bring these characters together for Galactic battle fit for theaters now that's a tall order but if anyone is up for the task it's Dave filoni who was a protege of George Lucas prior to the Disney air of Star Wars now as for where this particular movie will fall in the overall timeline after the events of Return of the Jedi and before the force awakens now those are just two of the announced Three Star Wars movies so let's not forget about the third directed by charmeen obeyed chernoy the daisy release starring project will center around Rey and where she is over a decade after the events witness in the Star Wars sequel Trilogy now it'll apparently see Rey establishing a Jedi Academy to train a new group of padawans in the way of the Jedi now with the movie taking place in an unexplored Star Wars era known as the new Jedi Order no relation to the pre-disney non-canon Legends era also titled New Jedi Order it'll be up to Rey to rebuild what was lost a very interesting seeing that particular story continue after the events of the rise of Skywalker as for what we can expect on the small screen well we did get a trailer for the upcoming Ahsoka series on Disney Plus now this series titled Star Wars Ahsoka will feature the titular hero along with other Star Wars Rebels characters fans of the franchise will be familiar with now it's really interesting seeing lucasfilm adapt the Star Wars Rebels to live action and fans of the three animated series are definitely in for a treat in August now there will be something for older Star Wars fans too now the show will feature the live-action debut of grand Admiral thrawn and the name drop of air to the Empire is a pretty overt nod to the Timothy Zahn novel that helped launch the expanded universe in the early 90s now we've known Andor would be getting a second season for a while now and showrunner Tony Gilroy gave some updates he said quote we started shooting in November we're about halfway through we're going to shoot through August we're on the exact schedule finished in August spend another year in post I suppose we'll come out the following August now those in attendance at the Star Wars celebration in London were treated with a few clips from the upcoming season which will be its final season and is expected to tell an epic Star Wars story all the way up to the events of Rogue one now Gilroy spoke about that saying quote if you know you're ending it really helps there are a lot of shows shows that I love and they're trying to figure out where they're going we know where we're going it's kind of like the escape from prison you know where you're going it's really great to have that sense of direction to steer the ship to the right destination now we also got our first reveal of Star Wars Skeleton Crew with Jude Law and a younger cast it's been compared to a lot of 80s Coming of Age adventure movies like The Goonies now no release date just yet for this one but we can expect it sometime this year and finally set during the end of the high Republic era Star Wars the acolyte will be making its way to Disney Plus in 2024. now told from the perspective of the bad guys this is the furthest back the Star Wars live-action franchise has gone though considering it's only a few hundred years before the prequels there's a good chance Yoda shows up and apparently one of the Jedi will be a Chewbacca so that'll be fun to watch right Chewbacca's are fun I know that's not the name of the that's the name of the character but that's what I'm calling him he's Chewbacca to me forever the force is clearly strong with the Star Wars franchise as fans of the galaxy far far away will be eating pretty damn good in the coming months and years you know assuming these movies don't get canceled yeah meanwhile someone not eating too well and who needs to take a slice of Humble Pie is John Leguizamo now speaking with TMZ he told the media outlet that he won't be watching the new Super Mario Brothers movie due to its lack of inclusion in its casting quote no I will not be watching they could have included a Latin character like I was groundbreaking and then they stopped being groundbreaking they messed up the inclusion they disincluded just cast some Latin folk where 20 of the population the largest people of color group and we are underrepresented now this is a follow-up from a tweet Leguizamo made last year talking about how they went all white with the casting and how the 1993 film he starred in as Luigi was groundbreaking for its inclusion of a Latin lead now John Leguizamo is clearly off his rocker as this new movie has Keegan Michael Keyes told Kevin Michael Richardson and Kari Payton in the Super Mario Brothers movie now these are three black dudes now that's far from all white and all white cast in my opinion I'm pretty sure you all agree with me I think he's just upset he's not in this movie The 1993 live action Mario film was bad let's just be honest come on now be honest with yourselves and the director of that movie came out recently admitting that they took certain liberties with the source material that they would have never done if Miyamoto were more involved now the mans didn't want to get his hands dirty with that film quit tripping you know he wanted to have nothing to do with that anyways John Leguizamo really needs to just take a chill pill and just be happy that he was part of the Mario Silver Screen Legacy I'm no matter how much of a stain it might have left on it to begin with at least all this hype for the 2023 film put his live-action take at number one on Amazon's best sellers list right ahead of the pre-order for the new 3D animated movie now maybe some parents were just confused as to what they were purchasing you know it's like that whole thing we don't need to go see Mario in theaters we have Mario at home type scenario yeah that's just a terrible thing to have at home but it's cheap you can get it now anyways chill out John please chill out we still love you and your terrible highly inaccurate depiction of brother Luigi and that about does it For Your Entertainment fix for it today I'm akima Washington thank you all so much for watching now that you're caught up on today's news please check out our previous episode download the IGN app on all your devices and for everything else stick with IGN

#StarWars #ahsoka",I've been pretty happy with all of the adaptations of Rebels characters into live action so far but I have to say I think Ezra has been the best I don't know if visually the short hair look would have worked for him if they'd stuck with that but there's something about the way the line delivery has been just in the few short scenes we've had in episode six of Ahsoka that really just felt like Ezra there's a kind of jocular almost cocky nature to the way that Ezra's lines are both written and delivered in the show that I think matches with this character better than anyone else so far I'm really excited to see more of this performance as we learn where Ezra's story is gonna go especially as he finds out how Sabine found him and the implications of that I'm also kind of curious if Ezra realizes just how far they are like he was probably just dropped off by the whales and then he's only been talking to snails for 10 years I don't know if they know they're in another galaxy

Vastly different to the Episode 9 that we ended up with it included no Emperor Palpatine, his Master Tor Vallum (using concepts from a cut character from the JJ version) more Rise Tico and General Leia, a double sided lightsaber for Rey, Kylo Ren as the main protagonist and about the same amount of the Knights Of Ren we actually got.  There’s also a Finn Stormtrooper uprising plot that unfortunately I cut due to time and money constraints.

#StarWars #TheRiseOfSkywalker #DuelOfTheFates",[Music] right so we open on Finn PO bb-8 Andros was actually in this version more than 76 seconds infiltrating an imperial shipyard in the hope of blowing it all out and that captured luckily they rescued by Rey in a Tuscan Raider disguise with a sweet-ass new lightsaber they all still a Star Destroyer and bail meanwhile kylo Ren is hiding out on mazda5 ADA's castle he's looking around for the ultimate power or whatever and he's got stubble which indicates both the passage of time and he's unraveling sanity it's like a short visual cue for both of those things he's also haunted by the ghost of Luke Skywalker who's all hey I'm a ghost and I'm here to tell you to be nice makalah's all I'm not nice I'm all about this super holocron I found he then activates it and an old recording for vader plays of the emperor who's still very much dead by the way because you know what why wouldn't he be anyway he's saying look darth vader if luke cuts me in half first of all bad form on your behalf you blew it but if he does take him to tour Vallum who was my fifth teacher you're gonna love him he's great then the holocron explodes in kylo ren's face because he's not darth vader and it's cast him pretty badly for real and he's forced to repair his face with like Mandalorian metal he looks like a real  show mate it's a disaster so Rey realizes that they've got all these Imperial vehicles on the Star Destroyer that they stole but no one is around to pilot them their army is too small so she looks at all those Jedi books that she stole the ones that Luke never bothered to read and it talks of a force beacon under the Jedi Temple on Coruscant and this thing can apparently reach out across the galaxy like a big old phone call and because it's old technology the first daughter can't stop it meanwhile kylo comes back to Huck's encore asam's and reminds him I don't like you and I don't like what you're about but stop the resistance why don't you also ignore my face I don't want to get into it also fYI don't kill ray okay by then tells Vader's mask that he doesn't love him or need him anymore and he throws it away it turns out Ray's been training with the ghost of Luke he keeps telling her to be a Jedi but ray thinks that maybe there's a middle ground on all this force light force dark stuff there's been going on for bloody forever before she leaves though to do adventures ray tells Leia that kylo is probably good and they says yeah maybe I don't know but hey I can you're a new thing so that's good I guess all right good luck caller then arrives on the planet Remmy core and meat store Vallum who says we should be friends and I'll train you but you're all about the past too much and Carlos says about the past at all kill the past that's the thing that I always say I'm about that big time Tory skeptical that seems unlikely but let's get started I'm gonna teach you how to drain the force out of something try it on that wheat creature over there Carlo doesn't it worked and he's super pumped about it he's unlocked a new ability in his force skill tree now going to that spooky cave that's similar to that one in the movie Empire Strikes Back tor says Carlo goes in and is surprised to see Vader he loses a fight to him and he's very unhappy he's got a big grumpy face look at that so it was retaliation he sucks the life out of tor Vallum killing this guy he's dead now meanwhile the resistance has managed to activate the beacon under Cora Sun and it reaches out to the gamut the Star Wars characters ruin kid here's it we get a sneaky Bossk cameo thumbs up to YouTube boss it's good to see ya Rey chewy and Pogo they're on the planet to bonad and that's a different planet and they're confronted by the Knights of Ren they look the same here because Ray's about to kill them all and you know who cares there we go she then mind tricks poe into leaving so she can go on a mission alone but he likes rain wants to kiss but she's like there's no time for kisses but they do kiss and then Poe leaves because of Mind Tricks ray and kylo arrive on mortis same time different places Ray has a vision of appearance and demands to know why you believing me four and kylo also has a vision where suddenly sees a little boy talking to han Solo han says hey dobe so mean all the time give me a lightsaber and little kylo says no cut back to chorus and there's a huge battle with the resistance in the first order happening one of those classic Star Wars battles of old even Lando is there flying a ship Ethan who's animating this this whole battle is it a bit is it a bit too difficult to animate I okay you know what they are about it here at least put Chewie flying an x-wing because that's that's actually in the script keeper that in it that's terrific good stuff reign kylo confront each other on a mountain ray says I know you're the one that killed my parents in that rain flashback from the force awakens and Carlo says yeah that was me Snoke said that I have to do it let's have a big fight they doing kylo manages to cut her right across the face and blinds her he then enters the temple looking for the ancient power or whatever he's doing here I can't remember but there's nothing Luke confronts him and says you know good mate you're not a Skywalker which i think is intended as an insult but I feel like that's anyways that's when Rey enters and she's got a bandage wrapped around her eyes I'm the light and the dark or whatever she says and then they have another fight and she shatters his saber hilt cutting off a bunch of his fingers in an act of desperation he drains the energy from which ends up healing his face he's bloody loving it meanwhile Huck's you lost the battle of Khorasan and he kills himself on Mace Windu's lightsaber others like a side story in this about how he wants to use the force now it's collecting artifacts but time for any of that - its keep a brief cut back to kylo andrade layer reaches out to him with the force and he realizes that he should be good so he gives her back all of her force energy and as he dies he tells her her name is Rey Solano and races don't you mean Rey Palpatine and he says that seems a little fanservice II don't you think and races yeah I guess I guess you're on she's then transported to an astral plane where she meets the likes of obi-wan Yoda and Luke they say good job on all the balance that you did after you go back to the real world and probably started Jedi school if you got time to do that anyways everyone who's not dead meets up r2d2 plays the events of Star Wars for everybody because you know he recorded most of that and then it's probably a big cheer from everybody and Finn wanders for a second if his force sensitive but it's a passing thought because he's not and then everybody stands around awkwardly in silence whilst I tell the people watching this to subscribe and like the video and also big thanks to Ethan for animating this please check out all these social medias which I'm sure you will I also have social medias you can see those look at those too alright that's Star Wars am i right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right so we open on Finn PO bb-8 Andros who's actually in this version more than 76 seconds infiltrating an imperial shipyard in the hope of blowing it all up but their caption like Lou they're rescued by Rey in a Tuscan Raider disguise with a sweet-ass new lightsaber they all still a Star Destroyer and bail meanwhile kylo Ren is hiding out on Mustafar invade his castle he's looking around for the ultimate power or whatever and he's got stubble which indicates both the passage of time and he's unraveling sanity it's like a short visual cue for both of those things he's also haunted by the ghost of Luke Skywalker who's all hey I'm a ghost and I'm here to tell you to be nice but Carl is all I'm not nice I'm all about this super holocron I found he then activates it and an old recording for Vader plays of the Emperor who's still very much dead by the way because you know why wouldn't he be anyway he's saying look Darth Vader Luke cuts me in half first of all bad form on your behalf you blew it but if he does take him to tour Vallum who was my teacher you're gonna love it it's great the holocron explode to follow Ren's face because it's got Darth Vader it's guising pretty badly for real and he's forced to repair his face with like andalorian metal [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you

Join my discord server: https://discord.gg/WbjueDpQ7Q",the introduction of live-action Grand Admiral thrawn was absolutely terrifying but once you start looking at a few crucial details everything becomes downright horrific the Stormtroopers of thrawn's army are dead this entire Legion we see before us is nothing more than reanimated suits of armor brought to life by the night sisters we've seen this before in this series with maroc and while at the time his death was a little bit underwhelming it sets up a much darker and potentially much more formidable truth if you pay attention to the subtitles during thrawn's entrance they are called night Troopers obviously in reference to the night sister magic so potentially all of these Troopers are no longer with us as thrawn himself made reference to the sisters already having conjured up special magic for him the biggest detail to support this and some something that Mrs corriban actually pointed out the suits are all wrapped up and held together by the same Scarlet cloth that the Knight sisters wear when sending out troops to take care of Ezra and Sabine thrawn also talked about how his forces were dwindling and then later after finding out that Ahsoka was potentially on the way he requested once again that the sisters use their dark magic in his defense and their response the thread of Destiny demands it could all these Troopers potentially be as tactically skilled as maroc was or will the sheer number of Troopers called up be enough on their own and what else could be lurking out there in the other corners of this strange new galaxy far far away

#StarWars #ahsoka",given the fact that Merrick seems to have been some kind of resurrected Inquisitor and in light of thrawn's discussion with Morgan about the Jedi and Knight sisters commonly playing out the deceptions of death and Resurrection it seems like these Stormtroopers with thrawn could easily fall into the same category as whatever Merrick was they're probably not all dead and given thrawn's talk of dwindling numbers there may be some difficulty for the night sisters in maintaining the spell on a large group or there may be some level of decomposition of the bodies that can't maintain it but if you watch them as a shot pans over something definitely feels off Beyond just the armor being kind of garbage at least one exception to this may be Captain Enoch some interpretations have Enoch in the Bible having gone to heaven to serve god without actually dying if pridia is heaven in this allegory or even just the return of the known Galaxy then that would fit with this naming I've already done a few videos on how the naming of new characters in Ahsoka has been fitting with where they're sorts from so it doesn't seem like a huge stretch here

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",did you know that this is the first time this has actually been said by a character in Star Wars a long time ago in a galaxy far far away begins his story of a history of the Galaxy part 1 by saying the iconic words that appear at the beginning of every Star Wars film in the Skywalker Saga however this isn't only the first time this is being said it actually somewhat retcons the Star Wars Galaxy by huyang beginning his tale of a history of the Galaxy with a long time ago in a galaxy far far away seems to imply that the beginning of the Star Wars galaxy of the Star Wars civilization didn't actually take place in the main Star Wars Galaxy however this could just be down to the Riders wanting to have a bit of fun and include this line as part of huyang's Tale 
280,-KWagomecms,2023-09-20T16:30:39Z,This reveal is MASSIVE,"This revelation from Baylan Skoll at the end of Ahsoka episode 6 may be one of the most exciting aspects of the series so far this has potential to be something completely new to the future of Star Wars.
#ahsoka #starwars #thrawn #disney",I really was not expecting the teaser dropped at the end of Ahsoka episode 6. this may be the big revelation of not just this episode but the entire season we learn at least from balon's point of view and if he's telling the audience this it's probably for a reason that thrawn in the great dathomiri mothers are not simply leaving the Galaxy and the planet because they want a change of scenery but rather because there's some more powerful force a powerful force which also seems to be related to the force based on a conversation we see between Shin and balen what this is I mean I've got no clue it's not hexagonal that's in the unknown regions but it's in the Star Wars Galaxy it's probably not something related to the Sith it's probably not something related to the Knight sisters and The Witches of dathomir given the fact that they're leaving this could be the big next threat that the Star Wars Galaxy faces and it could be one that we're still dealing with even in whatever coming next and I mean that like after the sequel Trilogy this could be what Rey's Jedi Order is facing off against it's also possible that this is something given the description of Skeleton Crew I.E that they're lost trying to make their way home that we could learn more about in that show let me know your thoughts

Thrawns new battalion of Night Troopers spells trouble for the galaxy and at the head of this legion is the mysterious Captain Enoch. Could this mean Nightsister Magick is creating an undead army for Thrawn?",the Disney era of Star Wars has given us some really interesting Stormtrooper variants the Death Trooper Shore trooper and Sith trooper but none have been quite as intriguing as the newly revealed night Trooper thrawn's new Battalion is led by the mysterious Captain Enoch a name that comes from the Old Testament who was a man that was said to live for hundreds of years before being taken to heaven without dying due to his Devotion to his God it's possible that Enoch was an extremely devoted Captain to thrawn that due tonight's sister magic has become an undead or Immortal Captain to lead thrawn's Army Of Night Troopers similar to what we saw with Merrick's reveal in episode 4. does this mean that the night Troopers are also affected by the same magic though it's difficult to say right now but with all the show's current influences from different mythologies and cultures it seems very possible that an army of the Dead are in the cards for the future of the Galaxy but what do you think let us know in the comments down below and click on screen for another video

(Because I'm never wrong) I actually really enjoyed the Live Action One Piece adaptation. It's a faithful adaptation that creates it's own identity without disrespecting the source material in the process with some pretty fun action, comedy, and performances. It isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but it was a Hail Mary that (for the most part) succeeded.

#onepiece #onepiecenetflix #anime #manga #monkeydluffy #zoro #luffy",guys I would like to apologize I was wrong about the one piece live action yeah I know big breaking shocking news my credibility is now gone because I'm changing my opinion instead of doubling down but you know what this is how the world works as some of you may know I was not exactly uh impressed by the first trailer we saw of this new Netflix anime adaptation and with this company's history with content like this I didn't exactly have high expectations I mean I wasn't expecting it to be terrible or anything but I was not expecting to like it at all but now the show is out one piece is finally here and I actually kind of like it like I honestly enjoyed myself quite a bit it am I going crazy so yeah I'm gonna say it I was wrong about this show I spoke too soon and I am glad to say that everyone involved in this project surpassed my expectations immensely now this show isn't perfect and I do have some complaints that I want to get to later later but for now I want to speak on all the positives because for one there's way more of those and because I've been pretty harsh to this series for a while and it's time I give it the flowers it deserves now that it's out and I think it's best to get the clear positive out of the way first which is of course the casting almost every character in this show is cast to near Perfection I seriously don't think you could have found a better choice for anyone in the story I was a bit skeptical about some of the actors especially in the crew but they all really surprised me and Yaki Godoy as Luffy maintains the energy and bone-headed endearment of the character we know and love while still adding a much more toned-down and human approach to this character in order to make him work in live action you can tell he really understands and loves this character which makes him all the more entertaining to watch he's just a very lovable silly guy in this show and that's all you need to nail Luffy mckennu as Zoro was something I was rather interested to see as the last mckennu move movie I reviewed was Knights of the zodiac and that movie was terrible so I was kind of concerned and while at first I thought his edgy delivery in the first couple episodes was way too forced that edginess was toned down a lot past the second episode and it became a lot more down to earth stoic and likable he surprisingly gets his few emotional beats down very well too I was really impressed with him here I was not expecting to like him in in this show when I first talked about him on this channel I did watch the roroni Kenshin movies about a month ago so I did get to see some of his better chops in action and it's nice to see that he was translated very well here compared to that uh other movie I have to say though my favorite castings in the straw hats really have to be Emily Rudd as Nami and Taz Skyler as Sanji Emily Rudd was the one casting I was on board with the most since the very beginning and you know what I was entirely right about her she is perfect has this character Nami was probably the easiest character to translate to live action since her character at least at the beginning of the story was always the most down-to-earth of them all and I'm glad to see that Rudd portrays her vulnerability and hard-headedness very well she's very witty and charismatic and when it's time to get to the really emotional scenes she absolutely delivers some tearjerkers and you know what I'd say the same thing for Taz Skyler too his version of Sanji is also very toned down like Luffy to fit a similar character archetype found in film he's very Suave and charismatic and his arkhan baratier was honestly my favorite in the entire show so far the farewell to zeph Wild different was very well done and was probably the scene that got me the closest to being emotional his backstory in this show was damn near as good as the Manga version which is so surprising for me to say in fact it feels crazy for me to say that he is my favorite in the show so far because I'm not even that big of a Sanji fan but pretty much as soon as he's introduced into this show he absolutely steals it he's just so entertaining and it makes me want to see Taz Skyler and a lot more stuff in the future the entire crew has amazing chemistry and you can tell everyone here feels like real friends that are enjoying what they do all of their performances are much better when they're together and it's very noticeable and there is nothing more addicting than watching shows or movies where the actors are having fun with each other it always makes the experience much much better some of the actors are definitely much better than others here however the ones that I'm a bit more on the edge about are still entertaining enough for me not to be bothered by them besides I'm not expecting like any award winners or anything out of the show but there are times where the acting is just a little bit iffy for me not often but sometimes I think for the most part everyone does their job either serviceably or very well which is enough for me surprisingly though if I had to pick my fav favorites in the entire show my two favorite castings would probably be buggy and GARP Jeff Ward is absolutely hilarious as buggy and yet he can still come across as intimidating at times in fact when he first got introduced I found him a bit more intimidating than I found our long in the entire show which is so so funny he's very explicit he's incredibly goofy but it's still not overdone I got a bit of Jim Carrey vibes from him honestly he is around for a lot more time than you'd expect but he never overstays his welcome and when he does start to get annoying he typically gets what he deserves right after so it's all the more satisfying Vincent Reagan as GARP is also very very good I mean he's pretty much just GARP in real life so it's really not a surprise in all honesty there's many other castings I loved too but we'd be here all day if we only talk about the actors because in all honesty I think they were all great so I'm gonna move on the action is very very well done here I said in my video on the first trailer that I was very concerned about how the CGI would look and while it's not amazing from what we got it's not at all the worst thing ever and there really isn't that much of it to begin with they kind of hide and hold back a lot of the CGI for Luffy's Powers as much as they can and a lot of the impact and attacks are done practically like most of the action is done entirely with practical effects and I love practical action sequences so I really enjoyed seeing it here there was this one fight scene with the red-haired pirates that just looked so so great and I was kind of geeking out when I saw it the choreography is fantastic and every character fights very unique compared to one another the cinematography is also very good for the action and typically follows the weapons rather than the characters which makes for some very cool Dynamic shots and I also have to get this out of the way but the set designs in this show are just so so perfect they are honestly what carries this show to be as good as it is for me because of just how amazing they look they translated these very cartoonish locations and added their own creative twists to them to make them work in a live action scenario without taking the heart away from it from the exteriors to the indoor lighting and scenery the effort and detail put into these sets are brilliant and they are so beautiful and mesmerizing to look at one of my absolute favorite things about this show though is that there's also a surprisingly high amount of moments scattered between episodes where the story will just pause for a moment and let the characters just hang out or have a conversation for some relationship and character development this is something we don't really see in the anime and manga especially not anymore since the story is always constantly moving forward and I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for pointing that out but it's true we don't get scenes like this so seeing scenes of Luffy and Kobe or Luffy and usop or Luffy and Sanji or Luffy and Zorro just sitting down and talking while nothing else happens is really really cool to see the problem with a lot of live action anime adaptations is that they never really bring anything new to the table that the anime or Manga haven't already done a hundred times better but here they add a lot more subtlety and Humanity to how the characters in this show interact they aren't afraid to let the plot take a back seat so that we can connect with these characters and get to know them even characters like hell mepo are given extra scenes that give them more depth than they ever had in the anime and manga and I think that's especially important for people that are watching the series without any prior experience with the story of One Piece the show takes a lot of liberties from The Source material but they're almost always for a good reason and it never strives too far away there are times that I will get to later that are a bit odd but for the most part most of the changes benefit how this show tells its version of odo's work and this next Point might not make a lot of sense but this show really is just full of good good energy I know that's not really an objective way to discuss filmmaking but you know what I don't really care I review things how I want to review them and this show is full of feel-good Vibes without ever feeling obnoxious there were so many moments where I was just watching and felt so so happy because of both the Nostalgia of seeing the story story being told again and because of the campy charm that this show carries I binged this show incredibly fast which is something I don't really do anymore like seriously I hate binging stuff but I did it here because I was engaged and enjoying myself the whole way through I was very surprised with how hooked I was on this from the very beginning I'm pretty relieved to say that the comedy in this show is pretty effective for the most part from the trailers I was really concerned we were going to get a bunch of Quip heavy MCU styled humor in here but thankfully that was not the case most of the comedy comes off from natural banter and interactions between the crew there's also a bit of slapstick which isn't exactly surprising for something like one piece but knowing Hollywood it's relieving to see that they're utilizing it here with characters like buggy and Usopp because one of the reasons why one piece is funny in general is because it's creative with its humor and they do utilize that here which is very good to see usap was especially pretty entertaining for the most part I honestly wasn't really feeling it with the more serious and emotional scenes with him for reasons I'll get to later but when it was time to be the silly childish goofball that usop is he was really fun and entertaining to watch there were a few comedic bits in baratier and arlong park that I thought were really funny and even his fight in arlong park was done pretty effectively it's pretty much the exact same as it was in the manga but it was translated very well with both the humor and the underdog energy I also love how Zoro and sanji's banter was done here although I wish there was more of it Sanji doesn't get a lot of screen time here so there aren't too many interactions between them but whenever they are together they bounce off one another very well in the manga they're like two dudes who just  hate each other's guts but here it's a little bit different like have you ever had that one kind of friend where you're just insulting each other all the time yeah that's basically what they are here they're not completely at their necks in the manga but the banter in chemistry is still there there mannerisms and tone make it so you can tell they still have respect for one another despite their constant insults and I like how that was done so yeah comedy is a big plus for the most part some of the jokes were a bit too repulsive and childish for me to laugh at but for the most part it's done more cleverly than most shows out there I didn't write this in my script but I also wanted to point out that the music in this show is very very good as well it's not the iconic soundtrack from the anime that we all know and love and some people might not like that but what we do get here is pretty decent as well there's some tracks here that I might listen to on my own time and that's a compliment in itself however there is there is one track that uh just feels really out of place whenever the fishmen especially arlong is on screen they're playing this youtube-esque trap beat which I guess is their theme song and it's just so so funny because it does not not fit one piece at all like aside from that track everything sounds really good but I'm sorry that's the funniest thing in the world and this is where a lot of people are gonna get upset because while I do like this show I do have to say that there are just a couple complaints that I want to be vocal about okay just a couple not a lot this show isn't perfect and there are things that I really hope get improved done in later seasons for one the dialogue in this show can be kind of unbearable at times now I did expect it to be a lot worse than it actually was because for the most part it's mostly fine but there are times where the writing is so melodramatic that the actors just cannot deliver their lines in a believable way without sounding kind of dumb sometimes it feels like lines were just cut directly from the manga and pasted into the script without trying to humanize or uh live actionify it more and it makes the tone of the show feel very wonky at times there are some very very intense scene so that I just cannot take seriously when the characters are talking like they're still in a cartoon I get one piece is a silly series but if you want to make things work with human actors you gotta give them more human lines and sometimes it just isn't that also this is something that I noticed in the show very early on but there's a weird inconsistency with the cinematography in this show now whenever the camera is focused on a wide shot or an establishing shot or even on the action it looks very very good like it's really well done but whenever we're close up with any character there's this weird facial and background Distortion that makes the actors look really weird and out of focus at times like it makes them feel like they're way too close like it feels claustrophobic and this is the case for almost every close-up shot in the entire show they'll be closer to someone in the background will look extremely bubbled out while the faces look kind of bloated and it's just so so distract acting to me I know it has to do with the lens because I know how cameras work which means it is almost definitely intentional but I can't tell if it's supposed to be some weird fisheye effect or if they just decided to not change the lens out for any of the shots sometimes there are medium shots too that look incredibly distorted and flat at the same time and it just looks really off-putting and there's no reason for it to look like this this show costs too much to look this awkward as commonly as it does I would give it a pass if it was just a couple instances but it's at least a quarter of the shots in the entirety of this show everything is just too wide too often and it makes the characters look uncomfortably close when they don't need to be I also think there's just some really odd editing in this show there's a lot of really awkward Cuts Like There's a scene where arlong is giving a speech in the finale and during his monologue there's a bunch of really weird cuts between his sentences that really pulled me out of the scene I was already having a difficult time being intimidated by him but the jarring edits in here made it even more difficult I know this isn't something that many people will be bothered by but when you've been editing videos for pretty much your entire life wonky editing is gonna be noticeable and it's gonna get on your nerves when you do notice it so you guys have to at least understand where I'm coming from here there's also some very oddly placed scenes here like a lot of weirdly placed scenes for example in episode 4 when we're in the second half of syrup Village Zorro gets stuck in a well and has to climb out so while he's climbing it's switching between that and his backstory at least to me this really feels misplaced because for one this moment isn't really that tense and it has little to nothing to do with his actual goal of being the world's strongest swordsman like this feels like a really anticlimactic way to show us a backstory everyone else when it comes to their backstory it's placed within some big character moment but here it's not really like that it's even weirder to think about too that it's placed here because the episode where he fights mihawk is literally the episode right after this one and that episode is pretty much all about their fight and zoro's ambition the entire climax of that episode is their fight so if anything his backstory being placed there would have made a lot more sense and tells a much more personal story jumping between the now and parts of his backstory then leading into the biggest battle of his life up until this point would have made it a lot more effective episode 4 is really the only episode that I don't like and it's mostly because of that in the previous episode they show us usopp's backstory 2 and for the most part it's just as forgettable as it was in the manga it's just him going to his mom and then she dies and I feel like they had an opportunity to flesh out his relationship with his mother as a child in a longer flashback but they didn't go for it and I feel like if you have the reins to make some serious changes to the story for your adaptation character moments like this are a lot more warrant then giving even more screen time to the Marines at least for me that's the case I don't know about y'all I just feel like they had an opportunity here and they just missed it and while those critiques are more minor and don't really knock the show down too much for me the one major issue I have with this show is that the Marines are just way way too involved with the plot here they try really hard to make the Marines as important as the straw hats they are involved in literally everything like I'm sorry but they are incredibly forced into the story everywhere we go and it's so annoying and takes too much time that could have been used to flesh out some of the straw hats more one of the reasons why East blue was so good in the Manga and Anime was because we were only following this group and discovering this world without very many interruptions it was just us and Them it becomes a lot more disjointed when we're following an entirely different group at the same time I like to see Kobe getting more development but they are just popping up everywhere all the time for no reason they're in syrup Village they come to baratier they come to arlong park and they never leave until the season ends and half the time they don't even actually do anything they just talk walk around and then leave they are shoehorned into every single Arc even the final fight between GARP and Luffy is incredibly shoehorned and forced because not only does it immediately follow up a tense and emotional battle less than 15 minutes after it ended but it doesn't have any point either because GARP isn't even going to arrest them he just leaves because he was just testing Luffy he was going all this way went through all this trouble just to test him I'm sorry but that does not work that feels like such a lame cop out and this subplot felt like such a waste of time it really overstayed its welcome and could have been reduced to just one of the major East blue arcs instead of spanning over the whole season there were some nice interactions between Kobe and Luffy but that doesn't make up for the amount of time we spend with the Marines we do not need this big of a look into their side of things with the quick pacing and short episode length the show has it feels like they were biting off more than they could chew with this addition this is my only real major gripe with the show it really is everything else is relatively minor or stuff I can look past but this is just too big of a factor for me to brush off it doesn't completely ruin the show for me I still liked it a lot but at times I kind of just felt myself checking out mentally because I was just wondering what the purpose of having the Marines in here so much would be and it turned out they didn't have that much purpose after all and my last complaint is probably the most obvious one but the pacing in this show is just way way too fast this has become an issue in TV a lot recently Disney plus does this with basically every single one of their shows the last of us had pacing issues and yeah this isn't an exception everything is going as fast as you can snap your fingers and while it doesn't completely ruin the show it does make some of the more emotional moments not hit as hard since they feel like they're just being glossed over while we still have time to develop characters I kind of got the feeling that there could have been more this show really would have benefited a lot from being 10 episodes like it was originally planned to be rather than eight and I don't mean 10 episodes to get to log town just an extra two episodes to stretch and flush out the content we already had let it breathe more even if you don't want to do that I feel like if you just gave the episodes a few more minutes it would have benefited greatly shows with just Eight Episodes don't really work unless they have very long run times or if they're more self-contained stories like Barry but this type of format doesn't really work with one piece there's too much stuff to go through to just have it be Eight Episodes 50 minutes each one piece has been criticized for its pacing in pretty much every possible medium like this isn't really a new complaint but this one isn't really any different either while it's not unbearably slow like the anime it is just a little too fast it doesn't ruin the show for me but it is a complaint but still those complaints for the most part are very minor compared to the Praises I have for it while the show isn't perfect and I don't see it winning any awards or anything it's a great adaptation of a wonderful story that offers A New Perspective of the story that can very easily resonate both with fans of the source material and with new fans since it keeps the heart of the manga while forging its own identity in the same breath I think if Netflix markets this thing well it can be a real success for them I'm very glad to say that this show and everyone involved here proved me wrong the only thing that worries me is that I can almost guarantee you that Netflix will see the reviews and numbers from the show and just start green lighting other anime live actions expecting them to be just as successful and I'm sorry but no that's not gonna happen that just isn't going to be a thing please do not green light more American-made anime live action series or movies please don't it's already too late anyways they're gonna do it still I don't know why I'm even trying I wanted to judge this show on its own Merit since I don't think judging it in comparison to other live action anime adaptations is really fair I like to just review and judge things on their own as an adaptation and as a TV show and I think one piece succeeds in both of these things I don't need to mention stuff like Dragon Ball Evolution or Cowboy Bebop to get my point across this is just a good show that I would recommend to people who don't really know one piece and I could see them really liking the show and getting into the story more so yeah this show to me is a success at least I hope it'll be but that is going to wrap up my review of the Netflix one piece live action TV show adaptation you get the idea I just wanted to point out that I did recently introduce Channel memberships to my account while I don't do YouTube for the money I do kinda need you know money to live and not die of starvation so if you guys want to see more content with more effort and better editing and resources put into them joining my channel as a member would help a lot you get exclusive posts Early Access to videos some Badges and custom emojis I will add more features as well in the future so I think it's a worthy investment it's only like three dollars so you're not going to be like breaking the bank just to support me but if you don't want to that's fine too I'm not gonna Force you or anything I'm not gonna be a beggar but if you want to join uh I would greatly appreciate that I will love you I will love you forever but anyways that's really all I have to talk about today I'll see you guys next time y'all have a good day

Zuniroa",all right I know you all clicked on the video to hear my thoughts about cats but I figured I get the less interesting movie out of the way first before we get to the huge cinematic event of the season so rise of Skywalker before I get into this movie I think I should refresh y'all on what I think of the last Jedi I don't really like the last Jedi overall I've grown to really appreciate what they did with Luke Rey and kylo Ren their plot lines are really powerful and thought-provoking I just thought Phantom pose plot lines were embarrassing nonsense to drag the movie down even if they did tie into the whole failure theme the movie was going for I'd give the movie a 5 out of 10 but I appreciate the attempts ryan made to make an actual art house picture with in Star Wars even if he failed spectacularly in my eyes but there's one huge problem here Ryan wrote Star Wars into a corner in my last Jedi infinity war comparison vid I stated and it ends in a way that doesn't leave you satisfied or wanting more you know where the story has to go from here kylo will be an unstable leader and his conflict with Hux will escalate Rey will train a new generation of Jedi build up the resistance ryan caios forces will fight Rey will win the goddamn end that would be the tired uncompelled way to take the story but good news the rise of Skywalker isn't that instead it's a fanfiction that was written by an eight-year-old and since I'm probably gonna be talking about and analyzing this movie for quite some time on this channel this review is just gonna be my disjointed spoilery thoughts skip to this timeframe to avoid spoilers three-two-one ports like I said it's as if an eight-year-old grabbed toys out of his bucket and made an adventure this is the kind of story I can imagine myself making at age 8 kylo Ren finds a super secret sith planet where the emperor is still alive and he has million ships they all have Death Star lasers on them so Finn Rey and Poe go to a desert where Lando is and he tells them go to the new ship but Rey is walking alone in the desert and Chewbacca goes get her but the storm troopers get him and put him on another ship kylo comes and they both use the Force on the ship but ratios like and it blows up but Chewy's okay cuz he was on another ship the movie is like this for 142 minutes it barely has anything resembling characters it has action figures that JJ Abrams and the screenwriter of Batman V Superman moved from planet to planet with no rhyme or reason I actually really enjoyed the first act of its brisk pace until I realized that I was hardly getting any substantial character moments you know the stuff that I really liked in force awakens new characters keep getting piled on but with no chance to grow on the audience Finn meets another deserter from the first order and they get one scene to interact his people before boom action time for the rest of the movie no more character growth from her Lando is thrown into the story for absolutely no reason and has practically nothing to do Poe is an [ __ ] for some reason Finn and Rey don't have the same great chemistry they did in force awakens c-3po was fun but it was just a repeat of how he acts an empire kylo shows up wherever the plot needs him to and his sudden appearance of the second Death Star was particularly stupid Huck's being the spy was dumb oh I just want kylo Ren to lose come the [ __ ] on man what happened to being space Hitler are you that much of a petty child that you're sabotaging your evil regime just to stand up to the big bully pucks is the worst villain in Star Wars history is decided the mission of rescue Chewbacca was so dumb which makes sense because the way you got captured was equally dumb but seriously they're just going guns blazing and expect everything to turn out fine who a good thing hooks saved your asses dip shits editing and cinematography wise this did not impress it didn't feel like it had JJ's usual directorial flare it just felt lifeless again force awakens is a well shot well edited movie this movies editing is frantic and obnoxious what happened the score is a greatest hits medley there is not a single memorable new track and this gets nominated for Best Original Score at the Oscars I'm gonna be freaking livid when Maz gave Chewie a medal at the end I said out loud in the theater oh come the [ __ ] on and finally it pains me to say that the Emperor was absolutely stupid in this film none of his lines are memorable unless he's directly quoting Revenge of the Sith his presence undermines the original trilogy and the previous films in this trilogy his undead nature is visually cool but conceptually bizarre and he's barely allowed to do anything before his apparently final this time demise it's just too much it's so obvious he was thrown in there out of a lack of imagination and unlike the prequels he isn't fun in this movie I was bored by Ian's McDermott's performance as Emperor Palpatine in a Star Wars movie I never expected to say that Ian's doing the good job as always but his dialogue and the way he acts is just so boring an unpopular opinion but I don't actually mind that Rey is a Palpatine I think it's the neat idea that the grandchildren of Palpatine and Vader are intertwined in this conflict with one another but it's such a lame-ass pull in this movie because it's so obviously was never the original intention or maybe it was for JJ but Ryan [ __ ] with that notion because Disney let him do whatever because they had no [ __ ] plan for this trilogy every day I wake up and I hope Disney is dead just like if I could guarantee Tom atoll will be okay I hope Disney gets bankrupt and then gets hit with a lawsuit of dies I'm sorry I mean to quote rich Evans for the record I don't think this is terrible it's sporadically interesting I like some stuff like Ryan kylos forced connection and mater teleporting powers growing I love the design of Palpatine's lair and his creepy cult audience that feels like a twisted version of the Senate it's pretty sick it felt rewarding to hear the voice of ahsoka among the chorus of Jedi calling out to Rey and my favorite scene in the movie the one heartfelt moment that landed was Ben being visited by a memory of Han Solo despite how rushed his redemption was hearing him repeat the lines from force awakens in order to make amends with his late father was really powerful it reminded me of a simpler time when I was invested in these characters in the emotional journeys they would embark on but this movie wasn't about characters it was about spectacle spectacle so dry and lifeless that it became boring nothing in the third act felt earned and I was just ready for it to be over by the time Lando came in with all the ships driven by faceless non characters this movie wanted to have its own Avengers end game so hard but it didn't put in the effort the decade worth of build up the emotional investment in numerous characters 20 years from now we're still gonna be talking about what an amazing payoff and climactic moment the final act of endgame was and this movie will be all but forgotten I actually think history will look back much more kindly on the last Jedi hell maybe I will too at the moment I still dislike it and think two-thirds of it is a waste of time but I appreciate the artistic merit of that 1/3 and how it pushed the boundaries of Star Wars storytelling not everyone likes it and that's perfectly fine but in the end it's kind of like frozen 1 & 2 for me the last Jedi is a movie of incredible highs and then suffer Bulow's like frozen the rise of Skywalker starts out fun until it falls apart over time leaving me with nothing as awful as the bad stuff in last Jedi but nothing really memorable or exceptional either more than any other Star Wars movie ever made this film just rings so hollow it left me empty in a way no other Star Wars piece of media ever has it's better than episodes 1 & 2 but at least I'm gonna remember everything about those movies forever if for the wrong reasons I don't think the same can be said for this movie if you like it that's genuinely great and I'm very happy you got something out of it but for me yeah 5 out of 10 that's enough Star Wars for one generation [Music] [Music] [Music]

even better right [Music] oh now I'm a fan of Bebop so when the live-action reinterpretation dropped I was right there and then couldn't even finish the damn thing because it felt like such a false cash in on what must be the greatest anime ever aired and now Netflix have dropped a live-action reimagining of arguably the most popular anime ever right now and that is one piece but here's the thing about the new one piece I've never watched any of the anime never read any of the manga I'm sorry it's just kind of a lot to try and Tackle it's over a thousand episodes of something and that's not even counting how many issues of the manga there are but it puts me in an interesting position I'm sure one pieces fan base have a lot of thoughts about the new show I've seen both positive and viciously negative reactions all over social media and both are rooted in their love and knowledge of the anime so what if you take an idiot who's never watched a frame of One Piece before and put all eight episodes of the live-action remake in front of them well after having gotten through this first season I gotta say I'm definitely feeling like the one piece the one piece is real oh hey thanks Patrick Fabian yeah what he said watching the Pirates Folly in total blindness to the anime without any of the expectations or desires of a fan just as a season of Television it ruled I was invested in the characters in the melodrama in the ridiculous spectacle and while I consider myself a big anime novice this felt like a live action anime adaptation that finally managed to capture the vibe of anime I loved Netflix's one piece I mean they literally grabbed me from the Ian McShane voice over intro now just for context the story of One Piece begins with the death of gold Roger the pirate king whose horde of treasure the one piece he managed to hide away beforehand and the plot revolves around this simultaneous hunt for the treasure but also the scramble over the power vacuum that gold Rogers absence causes and from that we meet Luffy Monkey D Luffy a kid with a dream of becoming the king of the Pirates Who lacks the means to do so I was so endeared to Luffy right away I mean from the first moment I saw him on screen which was the first hint that this show was going to make me care about these characters yeah I usually annoyed with the Yuppie overly positive infallible protagonist that we see in a lot of anime series but in this case I think the series did a good job of showing Luffy as a person in his good-heartedness while also adding texture and showing us how he got there showing us that he wasn't always this way the flashbacks and backstory really do a lot of the heavy lifting in making Luffy feel like a real person who's just you know maybe a bit too naive a bit too yeah he's your classic anime protagonist but he's also our focal point in this season and throughout the entire show and as much else the show has to offer which we'll get into I think it lives or dies on how invested you are in Luffy succeeding and I'm invested he was an orphaned Street kid without a family looking for a new one and he found it in being a pirate I love how he just sort of finds his way in the middle of the various skirmishes that happened early on and scrapping his way in baby steps towards his dream he keeps true to the spirit of gold Roger's original intent for the hunt for the one piece an important parallel that comes into play later on when he confronts his grandfather and his grandfather is forced to reconcile with the fact that you know Luffy has something special he has the same thing that possessed gold Roger and caused gold Roger to be the inspiration that he was as opposed to everyone else who's lost sight in all of that indulging in ego and villainy the show is in part about dreams and following them in spite of what the system tells you of the path it might insist you take and Luffy repeatedly awakens that in the other characters it really takes hold of that pirate Spirit of manifest destiny and being in control of your own fate for better or worse and puts it at the Forefront all of our antagonists are people who've been slighted throughout their lives whether it's arlong or buggy and they use that as a crutch they do a bit of role reversal and still uphold the system in place but now they're in a position of power and so they beat down on the people that have beaten down on them for so long and it really doesn't amount to much good whereas Luffy and his crew of straw hat Pirates believe in something more believe that they can change the system from within and revamp images by pursuing these pure good-hearted dreams not every pirate is like buggy or the black cat captain or are long there are good Pirates out there who believe in helping others Luffy sees piracy as a freedom as opposed to say Kobe at the beginning who doesn't want to be a pirate and talks to Luffy early on more as if it's a kind of indentured servitude a means to an end if even that and what's so great about that interaction is that that's Kobe's world view that's his experience because it's all he's ever known own working under Captain alvida he sees the Marines as this infallible moral compass and it's what makes Kobe's Ark so interesting is when he gets enlisted into the Marines and then is forced to reconcile with the reality that the Marines aren't really as good-natured as you would think similar to the Pirates they've strayed away from the purity of their original formation the spirit of what they were about and so just as Luffy tries to revamp the image of pirates show that they don't have to be these fear warmongering monsters Kobe does the same once he's enlisted in the Marines and tries to make changes and so the Marines returned to the core idea of helping people in need in this first interaction between those two characters is a perfect early nod to the pure ideas being perverted by human agendas greed and ego and it's important to the larger thesis of the show Luffy is perhaps a bit too naive in his worldview because of his own experiences with good-natured pirates such as Shanks while Captain alvita represents some more realistic take on the ruthlessness of pirates and how that has sort of informed OBS worldview and the entire show will be this exploration of that tug and pull between the negative connotation associated with the name Pirates and how Luffy seeks to change it the show focuses on being a pirate as a life of unpredictability but also adventure and freedom there are bad pirates and we are introduced to many of them throughout this show but there are also those that cling to the spirits of the rebellious Act of being a pirate of the individualism of sticking it to the system in status quo and basking in the feeling of that without giving way to malice and from the jump I love how the show captures that feeling through its Larger than Life tone the chaotic pacing the exaggerated characters that's something obviously really present in anime that is so easily lost or misinterpreted when transitioning into live action as we've seen before animation is Limitless which kind of goes hand in hand with the spirit of being a pirate in the show whereas live action is limited by some form of reality heightened as it may be but one piece found a way to construct a heightened reality that fits naturally with the age of pirates yet still feels Pacey and kinetic in the particular way that only anime can this thing is just so much fun and you know keeping true to the spirit of the show this one piece adaptation proves that just because live action reimaginings of animes have largely failed doesn't mean that they all have to one piece dares to be different dares to do things differently and it succeeds as a result and I think has encouraged people that yes you can adapt anime for Live Action you just have to go about it the right way I mean this show has tons of swashbuckling action and adventure and it's truly a spiritual successor to Pirates of the Caribbean only even more unhinged in after it's done a couple of lines it doesn't just feel like live action Cosplay that has plagued so many previous live-action anime adaptations they do a great job of developing these characters helping us understand why they're Drawn Together tackling insecurity toxic masculinity and Conformity through the lens of pirates it also helps that so much of this show is practical the sets are stunning the costumes are incredibly detailed this feels like a fully realized world old and it feels tangible at that too which is something that we don't really get a whole lot of in high budget television shows like this I love the recurring theme from early on in the story about the obsession with rankings and status about insecurity regarding how the World Views you and also wanting to be seen and known for something whatever that something will be it makes the stylized wanted posters that accompany the various bounties as cool and memorable as it is how they weave it into the on-screen action more resonant than just being an introduction to the character it says here have your glory have your infamy and a price on your head with it and that ties into the masculinity commentary as well the need to have power and fame can simultaneously be indicative of how a lot of young people young boys view masculinity in the senseless need to Peacock and retaliate just to prove their strength even the hunt for the one piece itself basically becomes this face off about who can Flex their strength and piracy skills more people have forgotten the purpose of the quest and the whole thing becomes this impossible myth and now that Luffy has reignited an interest in the one piece everyone wants to take his dream from him for the sake of their own ego because if Luffy has a choice and Luffy can accomplish these great things then that means that they had a choice all along and it would prove their worldview is wrong and Incredibly flawed a lot of the villains Luffy and his Straw Hat crew come into contact with whether it was axan Morgan with an ax for a hand or buggy with his deformed nose lack confidence in themselves and try to construct an image that bolsters their ego from a foundation of fear and a lot of the show is challenging people and their World Views just because something happens to you that causes scars doesn't mean it has to absolutely Define you for the rest of time I see one piece as really being about accepting all different kinds of people and learning to see beyond your narrow view of things I particularly like the dynamic between buggy and Luffy in episode 2 because of this it shows Luffy an antagonistic reflection of himself this is who he once was as a kid and who he could become if he plays into the pity party of his otherness if he tries to uphold the flawed egotistical selfish image of being a pirate by embracing your otherness by coming to terms with what's been and trying to improve yourself people will start to embrace you Luffy remarks at one point that you can't make people love you just like you can't make them smile as buggy has literally held an entire town captive and in Chains as a forced audience you can't make people fear you when they see you for who you are this show isn't just about Luffy though the other main characters rule too to take Nami again I live under a rock when it comes to the anime but I've seen a fair bit of stuff online about how unpopular she is I guess I don't know if her initial self-servedness is on par for how she acts in the anime but here it evolves into something much more selfless and it makes the character far richer than I think any of us expected early on she remarks about help and he really shows you who people truly are most people only care about themselves and what's theirs and Zorro spoiler alert the best character in the entire show calls her outs when he remarks that sounds like someone I know Nami doesn't seem to believe in others at first believes that the only thing worth living for is cash and self-preservation but underneath the surface it's not so simple as her just wanting to be rich people be damned we learned that Nami has sacrificed or lost him near everything that actually mattered to her and her selfishness is little more than a protective armor she wears she pushes away people who try to care about her out of guilt about what happened to her mother in particular she has this disdain for people in positions of privilege the elite the wealthy because of how she grew up she grew up in this little village that was raided and taken over by Pirates and resulted in the death of her mother and she was forced to serve arlong in his pirate gang as a means to help save her Village her mother taught her that she has to make tough decisions sacrifices for other people and so she literally sacrificed a big chunk of her life in order to earn enough money to free her Village and she played it so close to the chest because she didn't want anyone else to suffer but that's what friends are for friends are there to lighten the load to be there to boost you up and to help you along your journey and that's something that Nami has to understand she doesn't need to push people away these people care about her and want to be a part of her life and because of that they are willing to do whatever they have to in order to help her along her way in order to get her out of these predicaments and that's just beautiful there's an interesting dynamic between Nami and Zorro Zorro is definitely a bit similar equally stoic equally a bit hesitant to open up and become a part of this crew but he's also collecting bounties off of pirates from money but as we see later on he Harbors a dissatisfaction with his current lifestyle he's realizing that there might be more to life and that he doesn't have to be this way just like Nami doesn't have to be a thief working for our long that circles back to the idea of challenging beliefs Nami is constantly challenged and proved wrong about how the world is piece by piece nami's distrust is chipped away until she realizes that the point is trust people give each person a chance until they give you a reason not to it takes her till the penultimate episode to finally accept this when Luffy arrives to help save her from self-sabotaging she needs help to save her Village and is finally willing to ask for it and Luffy in turn offers her his straw hat and the crew her friends to help her on her way this is her fight but they will be there as her crew this time as her friends it's a great payoff to arguably the most emotional Arc throughout the entire season Zorro gets there a lot sooner than Nami does I really love his little extended flashback in the fourth episode he loses someone very important to him someone who shared his dreams of becoming the world's greatest swordsman to ever live someone who pushed him the same way he pushed her and he has to reconcile with the promise they made to each other to become the best and keep fighting every day even when it seems futile or impossible possible he carries her sword with him as a reminder of his loyalty and faith in the people he cares about and he eventually comes to feel that way about Luffy that was the point that cemented him as my favorite character It ultimately comes down to why the straw hat crew is effective and different it isn't ultimately about raiding Villages getting as much gold as possible or Perfect Plans for any of them including Zorro it's about Adventure and freedom that's the whole ethos of the show even if it's a paradox being a pirate puts a bounty on your head yet it's also the thing that makes you feel the most free it's also that spirit that makes this crew feel like a family whereas all the other ship Crews we meet feel like just that a chain of command that works like a well-oiled machine but is destined to fail due to the selfishness of their Captain ultimately it lacks heart that's why after Zorro loses his fight against the warlord mihawk at the end of the fifth episode when we then spend episode 6 watching him cling to life it doesn't feel like the show grinding to a halt just because there's less action it's everything the show had been building to thematically coming together as a cohesive whole Luffy is forced to come to terms with the reality of being a pirate and what makes a good captain and Zorro spends this time caught in limbo between life and death it's up to his friends to find a way to keep him Tethered to their world to talk to him tell him stories to let them know they care and that they're still with him they haven't abandoned him losing the duel is okay losing in life is okay and they haven't lost faith in him it's genuinely beautiful stuff and it's what reignites zoro's passion Luffy refused to stand in the way of him pursuing his dream because he knows firsthand what that means to someone because of how it affects him and yeah it could have meant Zoro losing his life but I mean what's the point of living if you're forced to adhere to the box society has put you in Luffy understands that and is part of the reason why Zorro reignites his promise to be the best swordsman but this time he makes that promise to Luffy and my God this isn't even mentioning Sanji and the struggles with feeling creatively stifled with the feeling that he's just running his talents Through the Motions the parallels between Luffy and his relationship with his grandfather and Sanji in his relationship with zeph his father figure in the kitchen or the story of how Sanji and zeph were marooned during a storm for three months and how that shaped who both of them are or usop another Outcast who Luffy strikes up a friendship with so as to get the perfect ship and crew his whole backstory of showing up to tell Tales of his false Adventures to his affluent but ailing friend Kaya even as the rest of the Town View him as poor horror and inferior a liar someone who's just driven them about as far away from him as they can because of his inferiority complex he feels he has to live up to the legacy of his father who was a pirate and yet he's never experienced life the way that his father has because he's afraid of losing the people he cares about of losing Kaya just like he lost his mother he stopped following his dreams and living for himself and has fallen back on stories lies not only to help Kaya cope with her Illness but to help him cope with the fact that he's not actually doing these things he wants to present this image of being a strong sure-handed Captain someone who's very accomplished someone who is worthy of his father's name but he has to get there for himself he can't just you know make these things up and all of the flashbacks and obstacles our characters have to overcome are always beautifully reflected in the villains our long for example the biggest threat to the crew is xenophobic to humans in response to how humans have treated his people the fish men who are yet another group seen as outcasts as the others and that's turned arlong into someone bitter and rageful a radical creating an image that aligns with what humans view him as because what's the point they deserve to suffer as he has he gives in to being a monster because of his trauma he's vindictive and wants everyone to feel as powerless as he once did but don't let the emphasis on character depth imply that when the show does kick back into its high octane action gear the results aren't incredible I mean even in the same episode that Ponders over a comatose Zorro there's still an incredible fight sequence with arlong that is just so big and ridiculous and yet it somehow Works Luffy's gum gum attacks seem on paper like something way too outlandish even for an anime live action adaptation And yet when you see it play out here in live action there's an element of it being hilariously ridiculous and yet kinda cool as much as I wish some of this looked a little more premium It generally has the VFX and choreography quality I expect from Netflix I mean maybe a little bit better in the choreography Department there's also a kineticism to this that I feel is absent from say current Star Wars on TV or the MCU even if more of those properties put their budgets up on the screen then one piece does but nothing Rivals the straw hats versus fish men fight in the finale I can't believe they made something like that work in live action it's unreal how embracing the absurdity and cheesiness managed to be so endearing but it worked I mean this thing genuinely has to be seen to be believed and of course our heroes win at the end but why wouldn't they a after everything that's happened this is a story about the Old Guard learning to make way for the next generation and Build a Better World eradicating old think and handing over the reins this is the lesson vice admiral GARP and zeph have to reconcile with it's scary to take your hands off the control but you have to trust in the next generation's ability to take over and take control of their own destiny the way they see fit follow their dreams just as the old guard had it's time for the Next Generation to learn and be the best versions of themselves as possible the Old Guard had their time and they did what they could to make the world better maybe they mucked it up a bit more than they were hoping but it's time to let Young Blood take over and reignite a passion for these pure ideas and it was inevitable that the straw hat crew would accomplish that the finale kind of Mellows out at the end there's a bit of a multiple ending thing going on for all the characters but honestly it works it genuinely felt like an anime ending in the best way possible after that big battle sweeping emotions melodrama teeing up next season's adventure and if the lord of the rings-esque epilogue is the price to pay for it I think that's more than a fair trade okay look there are some moments where it perhaps is evoking anime a bit too literally but I do think there is some sort of perfection in the insanity it's about as damn near perfect of an anime adaptation you're going to get in live action and yeah you can Envision how certain moments would work in 2D but in live action it becomes a bit much and in a few cases robs the emotional moments of full impact the child action in the flashbacks is a bit hit or miss and some of the motivations outside of the main crew are a bit ambiguous for example I can't quite pinpoint whether GARP is a good or bad guy even though he's arguably the biggest antagonist of the Season outside of arlong when the vice admiral says as he was doing all this to test Luffy did he mean the entire time he was chasing him or that final fight between the two after he's kind of come to realize how Luffy is confident in himself how he's the only one who knows who he is and what his goals and Ambitions are it's a bit nebulous but maybe that's the point I mean I love how gray a lot of these characters are how they come off one way and then a couple episodes later you'll see them in a new light and maybe GARP and his Marines are trying to reach the same level of Enlightenment as the straw hat crew have and that they aren't bad guys they just need more time a big reason why one piece works though is that yes it has all the anime iconography the ridiculous costumes looks hair sets and action but that's not all it has to offer and that's not even really the most important thing there are genuinely compelling character moments in fact most of the show was spent on exploring these characters and their baggage and especially for the main cast how being a part of the straw hat crew helps them unpack that and helps them figure out what their purpose and dream is it's really effective and it says something that I never felt like I missed the action or the spectacle I was happy to just sit with these people for a bit that's another Avenue I think a lot of anime adaptations go wrong they play so much emphasis on the action and the insanity of it that they lose that intimacy of the characters and why it's so effective in the anime one piece manages to endear you to the characters and their struggles paralleling the villains of each Arc with the hero they choose to focus on it features a really skillfully weaved in use of flashbacks I love how complex everyone is they could have easily painted these characters in Broad strokes but everyone had layers and an angle of sympathy even the people you think you hate are sympathetic to a point look if you're already a one-piece fan you might have much bigger qualms than I do maybe this show is some sort of betrayal of its source material but I highly doubt that given the fact that the Creator was very heavily involved and it feels like he was able to streamline a lot of the ideas he had in the anime and manga in a way that feels more natural and allows these characters to feel more three-dimensional I don't know I couldn't tell you either way what I can tell you is that overall this was an incredibly impressive first season it was remarkably confident stylish and unabashedly fun which is what I want out of a pirate story so you know what Patrick Fabian was right the one piece is real thank you foreign [Music]

マーシャル・マキシマイザー

唖々、臨界実験に付き合う朝
14听（ポンド）を嗤う蔑奴（ベッド）
「如何しようもないけど」
気が狂うヒトの振りをしているキミを観ている

唖々、面倒だったから切り捨てた
4U型（サイズ）を攫う烙句（ラック）
「申し訳ないけど」
擦れ違うモノに無為に期待を背負わせている

「夜更かしはイドの暴走」
「目に焼き付いた青の感光」
「モラトリアム的人生」
「最大公約数緩衝材」

食べてすぐ寝て丑になる 
起きてまた寝て人でなし？

「失敗！（Fail）」
マキシマイザー マキシマイザー！
急転 相まって壊したってDEAD強行！
「なんてことだ！死んでしまう！」
だがツマミは回る雁字搦MATE！

サンクコスター サンクコステス！
同位体 終（しま）いには取り戻したい！って
「無間地獄へ堕ちる！堕ちる！」
But a 眩みUnbalance 乖離Faraway！

唖々、生還 実験に繰り出すアラーム
旧四ロンドを微笑(わら)う劣等
「如何しようもないから」
気が狂うヒトの真似をしているキミへ

「簡単な言葉、信じていたいなら」
——足りないよ。
「申し訳ないなら」
——既に合う音に不意に解は求まんないよ。

「後悔はエゴの暴走」
「手に焼き付いた青の残像」
「モラトリアム的人間」
「最小公倍数断頭台」

食べてすぐ寝て丑になる 
起きてまた寝て人でなし？

「参っちまうな、マキシマイザー」
救世 愛待って焦がしたってFADE凶行
「なんてことだ、生きてしまう」

Lyrics:
Kaw kaw, begin the tests, critical the theories all
Leave me delirious inside my head
“Guess there’s nothing more to be said”
I’ve got you read, a sober puppeteer playing the fool to the end
Kaw kaw, a pain through and through
I’ll start anew, and tear away this scribbled size 4U
“Sorry, but I cannot approve”
I kill the mood of scenes I see no matter what that I do

“Night is the noose of ego”
“Now the azure is all I see though”
“Moratorium management models life”
“The wrappings keep it so”

If you sleep after eating you’ll become a beast
Are you savage if you fade out back to sleep

Fail
Maximizer, maximizer
Though I break where it matters, still I’m in a hearse now
“God almighty, am I running late?”
Will I die here bound together, the handle turning, mate?
Sunken coaster, sunken coasting miss
How I wish I could fix it, the isotope’s corrupting
“Down to hell you’re falling in a haze”
But a dazzling unbalance disturbs you faraway

Kaw kaw, return to life, a dinging sound dissipates
To tell the testing will begin in time
“Guess there’s nothing more we can do”
I say to you, oh personing mimicking—a tired fool

“If you want to trust the simple slipping words you hear”
—Remains unclear
“If you’re really sorry, my dear”
—You can’t expect a solution to simply snap and just appear

“Heartbreak hampers the ego”
“Now the azure is all I feel though”
“Moratorium management models life”
“A guillotine in rows”

If you sleep after eating you’ll become a beast
Are you savage if you fade out back to sleep

“Man, you got me, Maximizer”
Burning dreams and salvation, simmer into murder
“God almighty, live another day”
But resentment so rightly surges down into the gate
Fail
Maximizer, maximizer
Though I break where it matters, still I’m in a hearse now
“God almighty, am I running late?”
Will I die here bound together, the handle turning, mate?
Sunken coaster, sunken coasting miss
How I wish I could fix it, the isotope’s corrupting
“Down to hell you’re falling in a haze”
But a dazzling unbalance disturbs you faraway
Maximizer, maximizer
Maximizer, maximizer",[Music] the test critical the theories all leave me delirious inside my head guess there's nothing more to be said i've got you read a super puppeteer playing the fool to the end for you sorry but i cannot approve i kill the mood of scenes i see no matter what that i do knight is the new sub ego now the anger is all i see though moratorium if you sleep after eating you'll become a beast are you savage if you fade out back to sleep fail maximizer maximize your though i break my matter still a minute first out y'all almighty disturbs you far away [Music] testing we'll begin in time cause there's nothing more we can do i say to you a person named king a tired fool if you want to trust the simple slipping words you hear remains unclear if you're really sorry my dear you can't expect the solution is simply snapping just up here heartbreak camper's the ego that anger is all i feel though moratorium men even models like the canteen and rose if you sleep after eating you'll become a beast are you savage if you fade off back to sleep burning dreams and salvation simmering tomorrow god almighty live another day but resentments alright these searches down into the gate fail maximize the maximizer the white break we're in that is [Music] maximize our maximizer hey maximize our maximizer [Music] you

310,0wZ6MLfOq3g,2023-09-20T04:07:34Z,Ahsoka absolutely perfected this...,"In Ahsoka episode 6 Far Far Away we had our first live action appearance of Grand Admiral Thrawn.
#ahsoka #starwars #starwarsrebels #thrawn",in Ahsoka episode 6 we finally had our first extended look at Lars Mickelson as live action Grand Admiral thrawn which is kind of insane to say as someone who first read about thrawn many many years ago in a book I think I first got to the library but did thrawn's appearance capture the magic fans were hoping for initial reaction to thrawn from the leaked trailer back in April was mixed in many of the same responses followed when it was officially revealed in the publicly available trailer this July then again how could a few seconds of footage compare to the actual debut in the episode his introduction was in my opinion perfect the build up and reveal of the Chimera paired with the score which really kicked up a notch as we gotta look into the chimera's hangar all I thought was perfect and when the man himself appeared standing before his army hearing the musical Motif from the rebels it was the exact introduction we needed it was topped by just the perfect thrawn performance I mean we knew what we would get from Lars and he brought it from Star Wars Rebels his body language man that's what we saw in the animation in that attention to detail that fans are loving right now and overall I just think it's great now thrawn's older he's about 70 now I personally would have made him a bit darker blue but this show has really been sticking to the designs from Star Wars Rebels so I'm cool with it let me know your thoughts though down below and let me know what you thought generally of Ahsoka episode 6. we got plenty more videos coming so make sure you subscribe also if you want my full about 10 to 15 minute thoughts on the episode I will be uploading that on the Eckhart Slaughter Channel which I'll link on screen now

You can address any mail to Justin",episode 6 of Ahsoka just dropped I am very happy let's talk about it obviously full spoilers if you haven't seen me yet I'll just say I really like the episode but let's talk details also hi guys this is Justin today's video is sponsored by Vite Ramen we'll talk about that in a bit you can find a link to their stuff down in the description and a promo code but I know they and you are both eager to get started talking so let's begin so obviously the two biggest moments of this episode were the reveal finally of grand Admiral thrawn and what was for me the unexpected reveal of Ezra Bridger that latter moment especially I absolutely adored but I do want to talk about the episode in a somewhat chronological order with that being said we're gonna start at the beginning so there was a lot of speculation about what episode 6 of Ahsoka would look like I thought it was possible we might get one which took place in the main Star Wars Galaxy sort of Hera getting the rebel crew back together preparing for thrawn's potential return then maybe a hint of thrawn right before the credits but they went in the entire opposite direction every bit of this episode was set either at the beginning in the belly of a whale or in the new Galaxy at the planet paridia and on that note we now know what pridia is it's not the name of the entire galaxy it's not just the name of the route from Legends no it's the single planet a very interesting and distinct Planet I actually loved what they did here especially at the beginning it felt very alien especially alongside the excellent soundtrack just little things like those statues being so narrow and tall and sort of just jutting out of the landscape almost at random there were lots of really interesting details that had me fully engaged early on and I mean that's what you want we're finally leaving the Galaxy adventuring into a truly unknown place and I felt like Dave filoni really delivered then of course we meet well we don't know exactly what they are some relative of the night sisters their progenitor I guess but they do seem to be very similar to to the dathomiri witches that we know from the Star Wars Galaxy the main one is referred to as mother they're called witches on several occasions I think it's even possible that dathomir may be the name of something in that Galaxy perhaps even the witch's name for the planet paridia but I thought their voice was really interesting as well it added to the just strangeness and unreality of the world at one point shin and balen are talking about it and it's called a land of dreams and I thought that was very very accurate why these witches are helping thrawn out is probably the most interesting question asked by this episode not only are they using their powers to communicate with Morgan ellswith but they've also seemingly raised an army from the dead you see the Stormtroopers with the cracked armor one of the few leaks that we had about this show early on talked about these Stormtroopers even the bands which are obviously Reviving them or healing their injuries in some aspect and in a very thrawn-like way he's got cargo I figured just like with the thrawn trilogy his campaign was going to start with the collection of assets this is basically his transit to mount Tantus and I'm guessing that those things being wheeled aboard to his ship are either clones or more likely dead soldiers which are to be resurrected I'm guessing the three night witches will take the form of Jorah sabayoth which does make me wonder about the fate of Balin as well he makes allusions to there being something very very bad in the Galaxy perhaps on the planet itself he can sense it Shin she's I think cutting herself off sort of being willfully ignorant but I'm very curious to see how Ahsoka reacts I don't know this is very compelling obviously it's the JJ Abrams Mystery Box style it's super easy to say oh there's something very dark and mysterious and a great threat lurking on the horizon I'm really hoping that they've done the leg work here and have planned how this is going to play out and what's interesting is that this is one Avenue that the show can use to actually really impact the Star Wars continuity even after the sequels if they discover some really big threat that everyone in this galaxy is running from maybe that's wiped out much of the life in the Galaxy well that's something that the good guys are going to have to eventually deal with now I don't think it's the yujon vong I certainly don't think it's the grisk but I have no idea what it could be so that's really interesting based on the force though something the yujon vong and the grisk definitely were not the yujon vong especially were cut off from the force last thing about the night sisters the first thing I noticed when I saw them was they had different headdresses the mother has a single I don't know cap I guess one of them has two and one of them has none it really reminded me of sort of a fully dark side version of the mortise family especially with the allusion to one being the mother now this is almost certainly reaching but I just thought it was kind of an interesting little bit there but before we continue we're probably halfway or so through the video maybe a bit more I do want to talk about the sponsor fight Ramen right Ramen to make so much of what I do on YouTube possible there are videos that I make that I don't know whether they're going to do well but because white Ramen supports me I can make them I can also justify to my wife staying up late to talk about a Star Wars show but for real for those who don't know Vite Ramen makes super high quality noodles the flavors are excellent they are very healthy and they're American made paying their employees really well just a great company to support the really cool thing about white Ramen is that I actually partnered with them to create my own special flavor mosman Curry listen ask people who've tried it whether they like it that's all I'll say well also say it's fantastic we worked so long to make something unique and it really paid off all the nutritional information is available online many of the ramens have extremely low sodium and lots of bioavailable protein so if you're interested you can use the link down in the description and use code at cards for not just 10 off but also some special extra goodies alright so let's talk about the introduction of grand Admiral thrawn I thought it was spectacular the the way that the Star Destroyer was seen rising over the alien Tower was just phenomenal and the way the music was cut in the one scene specifically where it's sort of reverberating in the background then you get the inside shot of the hanger and it just starts really really cool I didn't really feel like thrawn would be someone to have his troops chanting his name but these obviously aren't ordinary troops the cult specifically night Troopers I'm guessing they're reanimated just based on the state of their armor also just watching I noticed thrawn called all of the witch's great mothers so just correcting my bit from earlier there Enoch is obviously extremely interesting there's something more than just Stormtrooper going on there I think but just a spectacular design regarding thrawn himself I really thought Lars did a great job I mean he is thrawn no surprise I wasn't sure honestly how it would feel and I thought he nailed it one thing about this show is that they're sometimes to a fault sticking to exactly how the characters look in Star Wars Rebels that includes Hera's contacts Ezra's eyes as well he's got contacts make his eyes look super blue and I think I probably would have made thrawn's skin a little darker blue but I mean that's such a small minor concern I still think he looks great some people complained about him looking fat I thought it was fine I mean he is a bit older here thrawn's nearly 70 at this point I don't care about thrawn's physique like in the novels he's an intellectual Powerhouse the only time he really gets into any action is when he's stabbed and when he's on Weyland at the very beginning so I think it's cool and the mannerism's everything perfect and I think you can tell that fans are happy because some of the people poking fun of at him have been doing so relatively lightly most concerns are pretty minor at this point now I gotta say I initially thought they got the Chimera wrong it looks like an isd2 which of course has that distinctive Tower however I was talking with my friend Corey and he pointed out that it actually is perhaps a quasi-rebuilt i isd1 Tower as it should be it's missing some of the support struts there are some additions made to probably preserve structural Integrity but it's correct I also like how One of the balls is just barely hanging on anyway it was really cool to see thrawn interacting with Sabine again it's kind of interesting to think about what Ezra's been up to like he's been kind of just in the Wasteland maybe doing little attacks on the Empire or maybe just trying to live thrawn is obviously aware of his existence and he's tracking him somewhat Ezra kind of seems to just be chilling anyway some cool stuff with Sabine in the Wasteland I thought the conversation between Balin and his apprentician continues to be very interesting I'm getting more and more worried that balen's story is not going to be wrapped up in a satisfying way which I mean it just stinks it feels weird to say that you want a character that you like to die especially when the actor himself is dead it's morbid but it's just because I want to see his vision of the character sort of brought full circle is motives just I don't know he seems to want some sort of greater power to stop the cycle of death and destruction that the Galaxy seems to constantly go through but then there's also that dark presence which he discusses so hopefully we learn more about that before the end of the season because it's very compelling stuff I thought the indigenous life of the planet was really cool the master splinter-like creature Ezra's shocked that she can ride it the little turtles I believe they were called no tea and one thing that's interesting is that if you watch what the subtitles on the creatures that balen and shin meet towards the end of the episode The Mercenaries or survivors really they speak the same language so most likely they will help lead to a confrontation next episode where we'll see what Ezra's been working on in his time away from the Galaxy speaking of Ezra I loved his reintroduction I thought it was perfect the actor not only looks exactly like Ezra but just nailed all the mannerisms the dialogue sometimes it's weird and off-putting when animation comes to life through live action sometimes it feels like a cheap grab at people's emotions no this I thought was excellent and I think it's only going to get better as the characters establish themselves more in live action like the first time I saw Sabine it's like okay this is their attempt to ape what they did in the cartoon but now she just feels like a different vision of the same character I'm excited to see how Ahsoka and thrawn really grow into their own as the show progresses but I mean that's all I got an excellent episode probably my second favorite maybe my favorite of the season so far I just love the feeling of this the alienist it feels like a new chapter is being opened and I'm very excited to see where it leads there's a bunch of things I didn't even talk about Shin's got some stuff going on the night sisters calling Sabine it I thought was really funny but yeah I know some people will be frustrated that ahsoka's not in the show but although the show was titled Ahsoka like it's not all about her it's not the Obi-Wan Kenobi show which I think fans were a bit more understandably frustrated at regarding his lack of presence at times before we go I've started a new fun thing on Twitter where I give Ahsoka spoilers truly without context like sometimes people do it and you can immediately tell what's going on even if you've not watched the episode I figured it'd be fun if I explained what it meant in the video the Cheerio is meant to represent the eye of Scion the Little Gnome is meant to represent all the weird statues Master Splinter is meant to be that creature and the slug probably my best was a reference to Ezra calling himself multiple times Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars Rebels I also did that for Ahsoka episode 4 I believe the boxing guy was a reference to huyang fighting that assassin Droid the pocket sand was when Shin basically threw the smoke bomb at Sabine boo is the ghost because the ghost was in it and goatzi the Justin Wang video is also a reference to the eye of Scion if you don't understand it do not search what that is I'm like it's it's graphic I warned you if you're curious that's on you not on me but that's it thanks for watching One More show it to fight Ramen for sponsoring this video again check the link down in the description and Views code eckhart's for 10 off and some special goodies I'll see you guys very very soon [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] thank you

Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favour of fair use.",devil Hunters chainsaw man 143 titled Roar has confirmed the worst kept secret in all of Chainsaw man which I thought was so obvious yet many still chose to disagree with me in hell guess who's holding the L this week spoilers is certainly not me let's begin the chapter with the spear hybrid addressing the others as children stating that they should Target the women and children to maximize the amount of screaming caused by each kill now one interesting thing from this conversation actually came from the whip hybrid where she didn't take too kindly at being called a child because she revealed here that she's actually 82 years old and she goes on into saying that she never ages that she's a superior human specimen and that she was chosen by God but for the whip hybrid to say that she's a superior human specimen now makes me believe that she was somehow experimented by and to be chosen by God now there's also something I want to know why the king of Terror or someone else experimented with devils in the way that now all these other hybrids could have been experimented with or why they were chosen like if you can remember back in chainsaw man part one when samurai sword or AKA Katana man said that salvatari gave him the katana man devil and but is there more to that that we'll discover later on regardless as the weapons begin to prepare their attack Miri is trying his best to go along with the plan adding that this was a message from God and that he just needs to steal his nerves as he readies himself to transform this is where we got a beautiful double spread panel where one two all three of them were taking out a quick succession however Mary still managed to shift forms at this point this is where we finally get the reveal of Quan Chi the long sword hybrid is decapitated shortly after though Quan Chi's back and this is the worst kept secret that Fujimoto held to the readers if the chainsaw man Church hinted at the weapons coming back as we got the reveal of the sword hybrid first followed by Barum followed by the whip transitioning into the spear hybrid why wouldn't we get Quan G reze and Katana man it literally makes no sense plot wise to only have four out of the seven weapons Back DJ mode quantity is not coming back Katana man is not coming back resay's not coming back guys have you ever heard of a slow burn yes let's learn more about four of the hybrids that we know nothing about let's get some personality behind them we now know a bit about the sword hybrid we now know a bit about Barum the quirky nature of the spear and whip hybrid more so the whip hybrid though wouldn't it make sense that we would get the other hybrids duh shout out to everyone who said ozone copium no you are clearly on gopio because you don't understand context in this overall narrative that Fujimoto is cooking oh man does that feel so good but now with all that out of the way let's go ahead and talk about wanji is wearing a public safety outfit hell we even see her reporting to the police descending special division 7 20 minutes after the media coverage that's about to take place now I saw this earlier from the chainsaw man Wikipedia page so take this with a grain of salt people in special division 7 is fumiko Yoshida could be spearheading it and they also included Quan Chi and special Division Seven but the news anchor was also talking about the national devil extermination Public Safety commission so I wonder if juanchi in actuality is a part of that Squad as opposed to special Division Seven we know that she had a history with Keisha Bay way back when when she was considered the first Public Safety devil Hunter of all time or the first period which alludes to the whole age thing the whip hybrid brought earlier if she confirmed she was 82 so then how old is Quan Chi if Quan Chi it's the first reported devil hunter in existence something to think about but I'm more excited and knowing that Quan Chi is most likely working with Public Safety as I don't want to sound like a broken record we have to see Keisha Bay there's obviously some plot Exposition we have to learn from Kishi Bay and why he was M.I.A now that also makes things a little bit interesting because you might be asking yourselves well DJ Mouse then why are the weapons a part of the Chainsaw man Church of society well I think we actually have the answer here as the news report falsely claims that the attack on the food court was caused by a gunman and that both police and Public Safety will be raiding the chainsaw man Church a senior member of the church explains that if the church's weapons are discovered in the building's basement the organization will be charged with treason obana and Haruka being confused only for the ominous old man to instruct Haruka to send all combat trained followers to meet outside the prayer room okay so let's go ahead and stop right there now why would they have all the weapons in the basement probably most likely alluding to Katana man and reze being held captive and now what I'm hype hypothesizing is I wonder if we saw how easily how famous was able to easily manipulate a primal fear via Chef mommy the falling devil I wonder if bammy snuck into public safety took all the weapons somehow manipulated them because we have to remember this Arc specifically is focusing on the themes of enslavement and freedom which if you even want to add to the overarching theme of Chainsaw man part 2 being that perception of justice and what is Justice and hell even just the sprinkle little tidbits we've got with the swordman himself saying hey chainsaw man thank you for freeing me you freed me from Oculus control but he truly have a free will of his own whether it's directly or indirectly being controlled by Fami or the other weapons Devils now this is just a long way for me to say the remaining weapons are being held captive in the basement then I would like to assume they were imprisoned or enslaved and whether it was faming or someone else house controlling the weapons to do their biddings and that's why we see these four Devils baram Mary the Whip and spear doing whatever the chainsaw man Church wanted them to do with Miri knew that something was fishy from the start meaning the following chapter or the upcoming chapters we are going to save Katana man and reze now the katana man thing could be way off but I kind of like that direction if it is true now poor Haruka he's just the poster child of the Chainsaw man Church alongside with Asa nyoru and I'm curious to see what asan yoro are going to think of this or if they are going to become huge targets following the break-in with the police in the National Public Safety going into the church but Haruka is completely oblivious to this I wonder who this mysterious old man could be could he be the fake chainsaw man himself maybe that's way too early to speculate but it looks like if we got a focal point on this dude it looks like more so what a relief in that the second half of this chapter went and way said none of us thought that is the Brilliance of fujimoto's writing so I'm glad Quan Chi course corrected everything and what does that mean for the future of the other hybrids and where the story is gonna go well we're going to talk about that more in the chainsaw man a live discussion later on today so if you want to see that video you're going to want to click right here foreign

#sufferents #chainsawman #manga",chainsaw Empire 2 has a bit of a villain problem which isn't an overall issue but instead something very purposeful in design think of nostradamus's Prophecy that is currently the only thing that has this Universal hatred and villainary behind it you could claim it to be the Big Bad final boss it's what's actually steering the direction of Chainsaw man's narrative currently however there is one character that is becoming more and more torn between different opportunities that is none other than denji he is currently in a position where multiple different people multiple different organizations can set him up to be the main villain an anti-hero of swords and while this can be a very interesting direction for fujimota to take and seems kind of fitting for the type of character denji wants to portray it's a little bit difficult to balance and something that I'm curious if people would actually enjoy it might sound sad and tragic but let me paint a bigger picture for you currently you could say that we have our hero or at least the story's hero which is currently going to be asamitaka now she is a part of the chain chainsaw main church and the chains of men church has a bunch of different hybrids but seemingly they don't work with Public Safety now public safety is trying to keep denji from being chainsaw men for whatever personal reason they have we don't know but that's what they want to do chains of men Church want denji to be a part of their group ultimately to be used as a weapon as that would be its purpose there's four other hybrids within there that have an agenda to push naturally it's safe to assume denji would also be a part of that if he joined so we have two different problems Public Safety doesn't want denji to do this change them in church wants dingy to do this denji himself doesn't want to do either of those things he wants to be chainsmen but on his own merits he doesn't want to be a part of the church and the organization that idealizes him and even fabricates different stories and he doesn't want to listen to Public Safety because they are threatening his lifestyle that's the reason he won't even turn into chains of ends because they threaten now you're tough so do you see the bigger picture that's currently being painted femi wants to wield war that was her original plan to find nostradamus's prophecy now we have the next best thing listen listen leave a like And subscribe or I will chase after you femi could evidently wield War again but now war is infinitely more powerful than before and has all of the hybrids underneath her control and anything related to the church worshipers she has an arsenal of weapons at the end of the day femi got the tool that she wanted and that tool has now a bunch of other tools underneath it and those being hybrids so undoubtedly nostradamus's privacy will arrive the question is what will denji do and there seems to be a bit of a conflict not necessarily within the church but within the ideology of different people within the church Miri Shugo who we know as sword guy doesn't seem to follow fully what the church actually represents he has his own opinion which is that of helping people he may be an ally for denji eventually however barram who he recently got introduced to seems very Sinister and chapter confirms that he's willing to go above and beyond to push the Sinister agenda for the chainsmen church and ultimately Fami so you could assume and very safely so that there may be a split eventually some of those people within the church will ultimately side with denji here's the issue depending on what Fami and the church want to do with denji they will provoke him they want him to join because he is the ultimate form of hybrid Weaponry it doesn't get more powerful than him if you want to stop something if you want to wipe it from existence pochita is needed in a trigger which is what we talked about in the previous chapter has to be activated now what is that trigger what could be something that triggers denji to evolve into that full armor pocher to form ASA mitaka being killed definitely made denji panic but the real answer the problem is none other than now Utah and what a better way to open up the chapter than we're showing us their day-to-day routine their lifestyle building up this beautiful relationship that they have being very content with life not denji but now you tell to me this is the Calm before the storm seeing Narita and denji so happy enjoying life and kind of just going through the day-to-day motion even though denji is very unsure about it and still not fully hooked into the idea and questioning himself and things around him this screams red alarms like I do not feel okay reading this personally because I know that something's around the corner the fact that we have a two-week break till the next chapter makes me believe it to be so this lifestyle that denji has currently which you can easily consider it to be the city mouse trying to conflate with the country mouse this is something that's been brought up quite often within chainsaw man and it's very simple it's basically just country mouse quiet simple plain lifestyle doesn't really have anything crazy going on City Mouse very crazy expensive food expensive taste but filled with a lot of dangers and issues finding out who you are between either of those things is very difficult and kind of pending as either or is probably inaccurate he is a mixture of both and he's trying to find what means well to him the opening of this chapter is a great example of him enjoying his time with Narita and the Simplicity of it but you can see that change as soon as he sees a devil he lights up his face is filled with brightness and he's ready to fight but he realizes that he can't he is a mixture of both he loves to be chainsaw man he is constantly reminded of the power that chansoman he is constantly reminded of the influence that chainsaw man has he just tried to buy food and he's seen himself on packaging all of this is rotating around his simple lifestyle eerily enough funnels back into the importance of nalita I think this is very purposeful for Fujimoto to do that even though denji doesn't really like what he's doing now he's only doing it because of naita because there is someone that is Meaningful alongside him that he wants to give the best life possible too free of any sort of dangers there is two things that have me scared the first one is a little bit more symbolic and showing that the plant that naota has is dying very rapidly compared to dengis this was shown before at the beginning of the story when she was first introduced it's a lot more dead now I put it like that secondly the angle of which denji is not happy you do not see his facial expressions he's constantly looking away from Narita trying to seek the next thing but because Fujimoto is so expressionable with his facial designs and being able to understand a character on such a level because of it for once he's actually not shown the face you were not meant to know what denji is thinking rather than just the words that he is saying I think this is very important but highlights a key issue that Naruto is the one not necessarily holding denji back but the only thing keeping him here if she vanishes if she gets abducted if someone tries to utilize her as leverage denji will lose control and that will become a trigger you can see him starting to disconnect but then as soon as narutobashi sleeping expresses hell she'll stay with him for the rest of his life and then he can be happy because she's cute he's okay with that he's willing to sacrifice everything just to protect her and be with her kind of fulfilling that big brother fatherly role that he was forced into it's very sad and self-sacrificial but something that he's willing to do the point is that something is being actively taken away from denji on purpose so he can be manipulated and used as some sort of weapon he will fight for her and that may actually be the problem this may accidentally coincide with nostradamus's prophecy and do you remember the one thing that chainsaw man or poched his full form would listen to when people were in danger save me chainsaw man imagine this the prophecy comes true all of these Devils start to flood in or whatever however it happens and cause havoc on Earth people that now know about gentlemen and worship him so desperately are going to call out for his name he's going to be activated he's going to fight regardless this lines up perfectly with what family is doing building this worldwide recognition for chainsaw man's name if he potentially kills innocent civilians because they're calling out to help and they don't fulfill his desires then the only other person that could potentially save or even defeat chainsaw men is asking mitaka with war and all the other hybrids do you see how easily the perception towards chance of men could be viewed as a big bad villain the rest of this chapter focuses on the movement of chancellorman church they're about to kind of push something into motion and they're going to be utilized as weapons so maybe a testing ground of sorts maybe for war Fami whoever but we have four of them I believe there's two more that we're missing which would be schwanshee and Reza right is there a third that we're missing how many weapon hybrids are there in total I can't remember I think that's pretty purposeful as well kind of build that excitement or anticipation not to show off raise or schwanshee I get it they're also arguably the most powerful ones I would say or at least the most explosive no pun intended but there is something happening tomorrow and a lot of people are going to get killed but Public Safety is most likely going to get involved so I'm kind of questioning the semantics and the politics of this upcoming battle and truly what Yoshida and family are doing I believe they must know about somewhat of each other's intentions but not necessarily the means of how to get to it does that make sense I don't think they're working together but I do think they have a lot more information on each other and are trying to foil each other's plans family's just trying to push forward all we know now is that the church is moving tomorrow they're doing something that's big and I'm very scared of what this outcome is going to be because who knows is it directed towards denji are we trying to lure him out are we trying to test the limitations of the hybrids or War whatever it may be I don't know again there is a two-week break so we will have to wait but sooner or later I think we are going to see schwanshi and reze once again in which would be absolutely phenomenal and may even change out perception of how the church works but also how they interact with potentially denji that would be an interesting confrontation

The prequel trilogy seems silly at first glance, which is precisely why its protagonist's arc works so well. Its tragedy contrasts so intensely with the trilogy's initial whimsy. Anakin's transformation throughout the prequel trilogy is a tour de force of writing, and writers can learn a lot by looking a little deeper at these films.

A full 4K HDR (and 1080p) upscale of the entire series, also taking all but 9 episodes and re-cutting them seamlessly into feature films for every single arc. Have a favorite arc? Order 66? The Rako Hardeen Deception Arc? Mortis? The Nightsisters? Yoda's Journey? Maul's Revenge? This project converts the entire TV show into the definitive theatrical experience, perfect for your nice 4K HDR theater setup.

I have also reordered the episodes to fit a (mostly) chronological order based on the entire series official order list. This fixes many, many continuity problems for those who get confused when they watch it in viewing order. There are some minor alterations to the official episode order to make these arcs work as films, but any changes to the official chronological order are small (Putting Maul's Season 4 and 5 arcs into a single epic 3 hour cut, moving the lone episode ""A Friend in Need"" up a bit in the timeline to fit with the Heroes on Both Sides arc. Making Cad Bane's seasons 1-3 arc into a single supercut). The rest of the alterations follow the official continuity order (2 season 1 and 2 episodes are now part of the extended Clone Wars Theatrical Film Cut due to them being part of the Battle of Christophsis, ect. ect.) and greatly enhance the show's viewing experience.

Tarkin is a little bitch but gotta love the guy",the Senate requests that ahsoka tano be indicted for acts of treason against the Republic a fair trial Padawan tano will have in accordance with Jedi tradition bias Jedi tradition I'm afraid Master Yoda that the Senate believes that an internal Jedi trial would seem biased therefore the Senate asked that the council expel ahsoka tano from the Jedi Order so that she may be put to a Republic military tribunal where she will receive more impartial judgment and who would represent ahsoka in this Tribunal Admiral that would be up to the council general but I would recommend someone outside the order of course the council will act as they deem necessary Thank You Admiral surely we cannot do what Tarkin suggests we need to stand together with ahsoka and yet there's evidence that she is indeed the mastermind behind the attack on the temple she was found in possession of nano Droid X plus herbs this alone is enough to convict her I understand your sentiment obi-wan but if the council does is you suggest it could be seen as an act of opposition to the Senate I am afraid we have little choice to the chamber of judgment summon Skywalker and his Padawan and in our decision may the force guide us 
327,LVa9Rm6nn8c,2023-09-13T04:51:53Z,Ahsoka Episode 5 - Ending Scene - Darth Vader Vs Ahsoka - Full Fight (HD),"‘Ahsoka’ Episode 5 Recap: Chasing the Ghosts of Better Stories..""Shadow Warrior"" reunites Snips with SkyGuy, but to what end? Now that we have officially crossed the midway point for Ahsoka, Dave Filoni has returned to not only pen Episode 5, titled “Shadow Warrior,” but to direct it as well. With the episode simultaneously airing in theaters across the country, it appears that Filoni is trying to prepare himself for a silver-screen debut, though it seems that he still needs to hone his craft. Cinematic digital landscapes and dramatic Light Side vs. Dark Side duels can only go so far, and this week’s episode underscores that. It chases after the ghosts of better stories, clinging to their spectral tendrils in hopes of drawing from the emotions they once inspired in the hearts of fans. The episode opens where “Fallen Jedi” left off, with Hera (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) searching for answers about what happened to Ahsoka (Rosario Dawson) and Sabine (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) before she and Carson (​​Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) were able to reach them. After a short while, she discovers Huyang (David Tennant) perched on the cliff face, mourning the apparent loss of Ahsoka and Sabine, in a way that he knows best — fretting over the fact that they didn’t listen to his warning about staying together. But we know Ahsoka isn’t gone, at least not yet. As last week’s episode revealed in its final moments, Ahsoka’s fall into the ocean sent her into the World Between Worlds, where she finds herself once again face-to-face with her former master, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). Anakin looks far less like his computer-generated and de-aged son this week, though the uncanny valley in their de-aging persists, made worse by the playful barbing between the characters about aging. Ahsoka questions what happened to her, and Anakin goads her with a blunt answer: “You lost a fight.” She does remember some of what happened to her in her final moments, which Anakin reveals is a good thing. If she still remembers what happened, then there’s still a chance for her to survive the whole ordeal. Rather than answering her questions, Anakin informs Ahsoka that he has come to her to finish her training — which doesn’t make much sense. Ahsoka famously left the Jedi Order and is no longer a Jedi and Anakin… well, we all know what Anakin did. Furthermore, Star Wars has been stuck in a rut with the idea that so many of its female characters need to train or to be shown training, while Luke Skywalker is left to build a new Jedi Order. We also know how that went. Worse yet, Ahsoka’s “training” stands in the place of actual storytelling. By driving Ahsoka and Anakin straight into a duel, we’re robbed of dialogue and character moments that could heighten the story that Filoni is attempting to tell. Filoni mistakenly believes that what audiences have been longing for is another poorly lit lightsaber duel — only this time between Anakin and Ahsoka — but that isn’t what anyone has been pining for. Especially not casual fans who know who Anakin is, but have no concept of why this duel with Ahsoka should matter to them. Even fans of The Clone Wars haven’t been looking forward to this, regardless of whether they've wanted Ahsoka and Anakin to reunite. We don’t want them to fight; we want them to talk, though, that’s a wish far too steep to be granted by Star Wars. Anakin cuts through the platform they’re standing on, sending Ahsoka careening downward like the opening credits of Kingdom Hearts, though it’s not quite simple or clean. She is thrown backward into a flashback of the Clone Wars, with Ahsoka once again inhabiting her younger self (Ariana Greenblatt) — though the foggy, poorly lit sequence offers a mere facsimile of the emotional tension and writing that the animated series once offered. Star Wars used to be vibrant and alive, but these flashbacks depict none of that by trading practical sets and unique locations for the murkiness of a fog-filled soundstage.",I didn't expect to see you so soon but I could you look old you lost a fight I don't remember trust me you lost it means you still have a chance tell me what's going on I'm here to finish your training it's a little late for that one is never too old to learn snips what's the lesson master live or die all right [Music] [Music] [Music] I haven't taught you everything yet forward hurry up next this was one of our first missions why are we here you tell me wait gotta keep up this is your training [Music] all right we'll be right back come on snips the battle's not over yet there are more separate asteroids approaching us is there a problem we lost so many there's always a price to be paid it was my fault they were following my orders This Is War I'm so good as Jedi it's our job to lead that doesn't mean we don't make mistakes you must adjust to the times look when Obi-Wan taught me we were keepers of the peace is that all I'll have to teach my own Padawan one day how to fight you know teaching is not always cracked up to be really what makes you say that I'm joking listen I'm teaching you how to lead how to survive do that you're going to have to fight what if I want to stop fighting and you'll die foreign I don't know this battle this was the siege of Mandalore we had parted Ways by now you did well you're a warrior now Ahsoka within you will be everything I am all the knowledge I possess we're part of legacy but my part of that Legacy is one of death and War you are more Anakin but more powerful and dangerous than anyone realized you've learned nothing don't don't say that I gave you a choice live or die [Music] conviction trying to die I choose to live There's Hope for you yet [Music] Anakin [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] how long have I been out one rotation however you might have been lost for good if not for Jason okay I owe you my thanks I heard you fighting hey I have an idea if you're going why don't you show Jason inside your Starship come along I'll show you the training room you have a training room in your Starship will you train me no Ashoka family finds that Sabine had betrayed her but she knows that she has done out of Goodwill and probably she will help Ashoka out in the episode six which is the finale of the season and probably we'll see them reunite again in the last episode of

Twitter: https://twitter.com/cosmovarietyhr",oh hello there it's me doctor who happy christmas everybody i'm here to talk to you about my favorite christmas movies the harry potter movies yeah they're christmas movies i'm pretty sure like a few of them the harry potter series is one of the most popular british exports of all time and no offense to british people but you guys just haven't made that much stuff okay that's fine i mean what are some good british things uh you guys guys made warhammer uh arctic monkeys i mean i do enjoy some love island but i watch that for the the big story but the harry potter series is pretty cool and i've liked it for a long time in fact the first video i ever made on this channel is a playthrough of a harry potter video game and you guys have been asking for this video for a while so i figured why not but before we talk about these movies we have to address the big turfy elephant in the room i know and love trans people and i've given her [ __ ] in multiple videos i've tweeted about her incessantly and it's no secret that i don't like her but then the problem is i kind of like harry potter still yes i have an undying distaste for jk rowling but the way i see it the films are not really jk rowling products a lot of people worked on these movies that aren't shitty people daniel radcliffe seems like a pretty nice guy and he says that she's wrong and dumb and i agree with him a lot of the actors and other people that made these movies don't agree with her and i think that it's not really fair to invalidate their work just because of one person i mean chris pratt may not support gay rights but you guys are gonna go watch the new guardians of the galaxy movie i know you are you're not [ __ ] fooling me over the course of my life span i have already purchased every single book and movie in the harry potter series before i knew she was shitty i played the video games when i was a kid i spent a year in college working at the harry potter theme park in universal studios i have literally given jk rowling my money and my labor so at this point honestly it's too late anyway plus if you don't want to support the movies yourself you can just watch this video instead oh wait no i was joking hold on a second this video is transformative in nature and in no way acts as a direct market substitute oh and before we start real quick while we're on the topic of copyright i've been encountering a new problem with these videos where the movies themselves are no longer blocked for copyright issues which is really cool but the music in the scenes that i show you guys do get blocked which means that the entire video gets blocked anyway just for a new stupider reason for instance in my aquaman video the entire movie got past copyright they said it was okay but the scene of black manta getting beaten up had all of the audio removed the same thing happened in my last video which is why the martha scene from batman v superman is just cut weirdly youtube doesn't give me any options except removing all the audio after the video is up or removing the entire scene so if this video ends up having weird gaps or scenes with no audio it's not my fault sorry so anyway with that out of the way let's start with harry potter and the sorcerer's stone [Music] this movie can be best described as timeless i think that word can be applied to all of the movies but this one sets the tone that the rest of the films follow we opened this movie to harry potter and his new york apartment where he works part time as a slave and this is where we realize why everybody fell in love with this character because his life [ __ ] sucks by far the best and easiest way to make a kid character lovable is to make him have a shitty life and plus harry serves as a pretty good audience surrogate because he's new to this world too we see it all for the first time through his eyes we learn with him but this can also lead to him being kind of empty as a character in a lot of movies this happens later on but in this one i think it's fine also check out what my man is wearing look at this fit i'll be crying if i look like that too bro that's [ __ ] up what they be doing y'all and i gotta say for a movie centered around mostly child actors i think the performances could definitely be worse some are certainly better than others and i'll say that the weakest kid in this one is strangely enough daniel radcliffe which is weird because he's probably the better actor out of most people in this movie at least when he gets older but he kind of has to grow into it and i will say it's interesting to watch this kid literally grow as an actor in these movies you can watch him get better in this franchise you can see his highs and his lows he was that friend and it's not like he's bad in this movie he's just a little more stiff than the other kids i think these kids perform the worst when they're just with each other if they don't have an adult actor to bounce off of they're kind of awkward that explains the blood blood blood blood see i like shots like this where you can tell the director was like okay kids i need you all to look confused hmm also it goes without saying but the adult actors are all really good and the one stealing the show is obviously alan rickman he's putting on such a fun performance and he doesn't let up in the later movies either he keeps his energy throughout the series just from his first scene his introduction you can tell that he is different than everybody else i can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses ooh this man is gay however i could say that this movie does have one of the weaker villains the mastermind of this movie is jeff bezos and i guess he's kind of on the weaker side because we're led to believe in this movie that snape is the villain and it's kind of like a little bait and switch and as a bait and switch i guess it's fine because at the time you're not really supposed to think that snape's a good guy because i mean look at him i think most the reason why i can't complain about this is because this is just a really solid movie it's quite hard to poke holes in it i also like a lot of the effects in these early movies the later movies kind of do away with a lot of the practical effects but in this movie and the next one we have some really cool sets and awesome effects makeup and even the primitive cg doesn't really look that bad here i mean especially considering this is like what 2001 this looks fine for 2001 if you ask me however i will say there are some narrative issues that i have with this first movie for instance there are some holes in the world building it takes a few movies for us to learn why muggles can't see the stuff that wizards are doing we don't know why wizards are a secret to the world and we don't really know how they fit into the world at large i also don't like that we don't really find out much about the other houses and hogwarts in this movie they focus on gryffindor and slytherin a lot but in all of these movies we only meet like one or two children from hufflepuff and ravenclaw and with that being said in a lot of these movies you kind of forget that the slytherins are even there it's very much the gryffindor show here yeah jk built a really cool fantastical world that we only see one aspect of and also if you try to nitpick the story you can probably find some weird holes like why the [ __ ] does coral want to secretly ruin harry's quidditch game did voldemort really tell him to sabotage the sports game what's your [ __ ] deal man come on also i love how harry literally sits and watches the whole game without doing anything to help oh my god that sucks bro [Music] damn you guys are really losing huh if only i could do something to help if you compare these first two stories to the rest of the series things also don't always work as far as the writing goes jk rowling like many other authors like to make things up as she goes along but her special trait is that she likes to lie and pretend that she actually planned everything from the beginning i went into this a lot more in my video about the fantastic beasts movie so go watch that if you want to why does voldemort try to kill harry if he needs harry to be alive so he can regain his true form well that's because jk didn't come up with that rule until later i'm not stupid jk come on but overall i think the story in this movie has a pretty good flow it's not trying to be overly complicated it's a very simple kids mystery fantasy story and i like how the final challenge for the main characters in this movie is this test of all of the abilities that we've seen them have so far hermione gets to be smart harry gets to do his broom thing and ron gets to die look at this dude he's faking it his ass is not asleep you'll be okay harry you're a great wizard wait a minute i wouldn't say that he's a great wizard and honestly if we think about it harry has not casted a single spell in this movie and i went back and checked i'm not [ __ ] kidding in this entire movie he does not use his wand to cast a single spell hell the final battle is actually strangely barbaric compared to the rest of the stuff we see in this series the villain doesn't even try to kill harry with a spell he just tries to choke his ass out if you watch this for the first time it's a pretty cute story and then if you watch it too many times over the course of your lifetime like i have you kind of can't watch it the same way again because now i watch this movie and i think harry's kind of dumb and he's gullible and he does whatever anybody tells him to do come here potter now okie dokie but anyway that's the first movie it's hard to hate on this i'm just goofing this movie's fine this movie is timeless as hell and it's a great start to the series it's not really gonna blow your mind at this point but i remember back when i saw it this [ __ ] was legit and i always really like when the first movie in a long series nails the tone so i'ma give this one a 7 out of 10. i don't know the score doesn't really matter in these they're like all the same why am i reviewing all these again anyway next movie harry potter 2 is really long there's a lot of [ __ ] that happens in this movie like seriously a lot there's [ __ ] in this movie that i straight up forget about every time i watch it and if i try to lay out the plot of this movie it's kind of insane so that's exactly what i'm gonna do so this movie opens with harry being visited by gollum and i should point out that for 2002 this little dude looks really good so anyway dobby tells harry that he can't go to school this year because he heard that his master lucius malfoy is talking about this evil plan to wreak havoc in hogwarts and dobby doesn't want harry to be in danger because he's like a huge fan of his i guess but harry ignores him because he wants to go to school so him and his friends all go back to school shopping and malfoy's dad shows up and he talks about how racist he is and how he hates muggles and mudbloods see this movie introduces wizard racism which is good because i saw the first one and i remember saying damn this movie is good but it'd be way better with racism in it and look jk rowling even came up with a new slur for this universe he did not so lucius malfoy's plan is to secretly slip an evil magical diary into the cauldron that belongs to ron's 11 year old sister you see this magic evil diary belonged to voldemort so malfoy's dad is hoping that ginny will open the magic evil diary and become possessed by the spirit of young sexy voldemort oh and jk rowling retcons it later so that the diary is actually one of voldemort's secret magical artifacts that are a part of his soul that he split apart but again i'm not [ __ ] stupid and i know you came up with that [ __ ] later because why the [ __ ] would voldemort give lucius malfoy one of his horcruxes just so he could give it to ginny so anyway jenny starts talking to young sexy ghost voldemort in secret and he tells her to open the chamber of secrets which is an evil ancient torture chamber where one of the founders of hogwarts used to send impure wizards so they would be [ __ ] killed by a giant snake so basically this giant [ __ ] snake travels through the walls of hogwarts to go around and kill impure wizards because salazar slytherin taught the snake to be racist and that sounds like the kind of thing i would make up but it's actually [ __ ] true because harry can literally hear what the snake is saying and all it talks about is how badly it wants to murder the mudblood children so yeah this story is basically just ginny using the death note to cause problems around the school she [ __ ] bleeds a cat writes hate speech on the walls in its blood blood she tries to kill like three students she almost kills a ghost i don't even know that was [ __ ] possible and in general she participates in actual terrorism over the course of the entire school year until harry finds out what's going on he goes into the chamber he kills the snake with a sword which is pretty cool but i'm still wondering why he's not casting any [ __ ] spells use magic you [ __ ] idiot you have a wand and when it's all over lucious is like harry you [ __ ] you ruined my weird complicated plan and then he tries to kill harry he starts to [ __ ] say ivana kadabra he was gonna kill his ass right outside of dumbledore's office how are you planning on getting away with that you [ __ ] idiot the one thing that bothers me about this movie is this is the one where dumbledore is definitely the most irresponsible he probably knows about the giant racist snake but he can't find the ancient nazi torture chamber so oh well the children can tell that gilroy lockhart is a fraud but dumbledore the wisest coolest wizard still hires him to work with children for some reason this movie's just really dumb to me now that i'm watching it again i hadn't seen it in a while so much of this movie falls apart under the lightest bit of scrutiny the snake is [ __ ] gigantic but it can still crawl around inside the walls why didn't any of the ghosts see it i wouldn't normally nitpick this hard but ghosts are actually a pretty important plot point in this movie one of the people who got killed by the snake is a ghost and she literally lives inside the bathroom that has the entrance to the chamber of secrets why didn't she see jenny opening it why couldn't she see the snake crawling around inside the pipes i wouldn't be questioning this if moaning myrtle didn't live inside the [ __ ] toilet also it's kind of dumb how harry goes to aragog the giant spider and he asks him hey are you an evil monster that's terrorizing the students and aragog's like what no and harry's like okay cool i was just checking but then aragog's like yeah no problem okay i'm gonna eat you now [Music] but by far one of the things about this story in particular that is just so [ __ ] funny to me is the reveal of tom riddle secretly being voldemort jk rowling really wanted to take voldemort's name and tom riddle's name and connect them so she came up with this voldemort's name is just an anagram of tom marvolo riddle but i can't stop thinking of young voldemort writing in his little diary i am lord voldemort this makes voldemort so much less cool and marvolo's not even a [ __ ] real name it is like the fakest name i've ever heard jk rowling just [ __ ] sucks at making names alright her names are worse than star wars names sometimes because jar jar binks is a dumb name but it does sound like the name of a weird alien so i give it a pass i don't give a pass to porpentina or albus percival wolfrick brian dumbledore but you know i will say remus lupin is a pretty cool name for a werewolf but isn't it a weird coincidence that the guy whose birth name is literally lupine just so happens to end up accidentally becoming a werewolf later in his life whatever it's a [ __ ] kids book i don't care also in this story we find out that haggard lost his wand and got expelled because he was framed by young voldemort and even though we find out that haggard was innocent dumbledore still doesn't let hagrid do magic instead he lets him work for him in the next movie so he graduates from slavery to indentured servitude so thanks for that dumbledore just [ __ ] stands by while henry gets arrested in this movie he lets him get sent to [ __ ] azkaban which we learn later on is basically super jail dumbledore is such a useless piece of [ __ ] isn't this guy supposed to be your friend now yes i spent a lot of time making fun of this movie but this is the movie that's pretty easy to make fun of it still does have a lot of the same good things that you'd expect from this series like i said the effects are better than they were even in the last movie and i liked the effects in the last movie just fine i think this movie actually looks perfectly fine by today's standards and also i should say that the kids in this one are a lot better at acting than they were in the last movie they're starting not to feel like child actors anymore in this one i also do like how this movie raises the stakes a little bit the first movie talks about the threat of death a lot but this movie shows us that dying is an actual possibility being a child does not make you immune to dying also harry gets to use a sword to fight a giant monster in the final battle i'm a simple man if i see a fantasy adventure series i want to see my main character fight a giant monster with a sword like i said all the harry potter movies are basically on the same level for me this one's just a little weaker than the others it's still a cute charming adventure movie but the story is needlessly convoluted and honestly if you erase it from the series nothing really changes in this story minus the [ __ ] horcrux thing but we've already talked about how stupid that is this is a weird one it's definitely not my favorite i'm gonna give it like a five out of ten i guess and then we'll move on [Music] harry potter three is [ __ ] awesome this is where these movies get good and you can tell right at the beginning right from the start you can feel how the tone is different the colors are darker the jokes are better and overall this movie just has more life to it has more of its own personality if you ask me the harry potter movie slide along a scale on one end you have the childlike whimsical fantasy and on the other end you have like creepy mysterious fantasy the movies kind of grow up with the audience oh and this is mostly due to the fact that this movie was directed by [ __ ] alfonzo carone director of gravity and even some movies that are good he knows what he's [ __ ] doing and it shows in fact nerdwriter has a really good video on why this movie is the best one and i fully agree with all of his points there is just so much in this movie to appreciate from a filmmaking standpoint i should also say that the performances kind of stand out in this one for me too most notably from the adult actors i like this one scene where all of the grown-ups are basically just acting at each other it's like a little shakespeare scene i [ __ ] love it and i've said it before but alan rickman really is the best thing about all of these movies he gives it his all in every single one i love how hard he goes every little mannerism is calculated and i just love how extra he is and the story in this movie is really cool too this is the first movie where it's exciting and engaging from beginning to end and there's no like dumb convoluted side plots and this is a movie with time travel the fact that it's not convoluted is somehow a miracle also if you're not aware this movie has really clever long takes this director really likes his long takes and i think he uses them really well in this movie also the action is kept up pretty well in the beginning of this movie we have a few little exciting set pieces that keep us invested this confrontation on the hogwarts express is actually a really good way of keeping the tension up without being a cheap action scene i really like just throwing a random [ __ ] horror movie scene in the middle of our kids adventure and then we're introduced to lupin who's a really cool character i really like him i wish he was in more [ __ ] movies but whatever it's fine i'll deal with it i also like these little extra scenes that weren't in the book and just set the tone like this frog choir scene i can't play the music because i'll get [ __ ] but it's cool trust me there's also this cute scene of the boys goofing off and then we pan over to see that the threat of the dementors is still present it's good juxtaposition and again this isn't in the book all of the harry potter stories take place over the course of a school year and i really like how we're shown the change of the seasons with these little vignettes about the whomping willow this movie's also shot really [ __ ] well i love some of the shots that he does in this movie corone does this thing where he likes to go through glass and it happens like three or four times in this movie there are a lot of scenes in this movie that don't need long takes but they have them anyway look at this [ __ ] insane shot we start by going through the mirror because again corona likes doing that and then hermione appears in the shot and ron remarks on her appearing out of nowhere because if we look back she wasn't [ __ ] there remember that hermione is time traveling around in this movie and we literally see her just blip into the scene it's really [ __ ] cool this movie just starts adding a lot of extra things that weren't in the books and it makes it better every time and if you ask me the story gets particularly interesting once harry and the gang start time traveling which normally i would never say about a story with time travel because in this movie you think the story has reached its climax with the villain being revealed and then a showdown with the dementors and honestly everything up to this point has just gone to [ __ ] but it's still really exciting as far as we know the cute magical pokemon was executed lupin turned into a monster and disappeared and sirius is about to be executed everything [ __ ] sucks but then they go back in time and reverse engineer it so that everything goes their way and you know i don't like to give jk rowling credit but this is the one narrative that is almost airtight almost the only major problem with this story is just the concept of the time turner because honestly you can't just introduce the concept of time travel without messing things up a little bit because now we're gonna wonder well why didn't anybody go back in time and kill voldemort why didn't anybody go back in time and save harry's parents all jk rowling has to do is say something like oh the time turners only go back 24 hours or something like that there's so many ways to fix this problem but no her stupid ass had to double down because she has to make it seem like she doesn't make mistakes if you call her out for anything she tries to justify it because she's stubborn as [ __ ] oh hey jk rowling isn't it kind of dumb that nobody ever time traveled to stop voldemort uh yeah well it is dumb and that's why in my new book they go back in time and everything's bad and they go back in time to save cedric and voldemort rules the world and the world is run by nazis so yeah there you go haha i swear to god this woman is so bad at taking l's but hey we get more chances to make fun of her in the later books because of this so i'll take it i will say that the time travel if contained to this story works pretty well we find out that things didn't actually go badly because time is like a loop where you can't really change much that happens i've seen time travel in a lot of stories that i really like that was done way worse i just think there's so much to love in this movie i could probably make a whole video about it myself i love snape's personal stake in the story how he has to confront the people who abused him in his childhood i like this little moment where he protects the kids the twist villain is pretty good and i like how the story doesn't really have a conventional antagonist i'd say that the main villains of this movie are fear and like time i think that's pretty [ __ ] cool and i like it that harry in this story takes it upon himself to learn stronger magic we just had two movies where he really doesn't do a lot of magic which is weird because it's a story about [ __ ] wizards so it's nice to see him like actually try for once and then it builds up to this great moment where he expects someone to come in and save the day for him because that's kind of what's happened every time up until now and then he realizes nobody's coming to help him and he has to save the day himself it's really cool i like it a lot it's a very good moment in this series oh and of course i cannot talk about this movie without mentioning the absolutely insane final shot [Music] this [ __ ] makes me laugh every time i watch this movie in a worse movie this final shot would be ridiculous but i think it's funny and i like this movie so i'm gonna give it a pass it's my video [ __ ] you i can say whatever i want there's a lot of things that i like that i can't really get into because then this video would be really long i like this movie and that's not really a surprise because everybody likes this one this is a lot of people's favorite and with this one you can kind of see why i'm okay with defending these movies even though i don't like jk rowling most of what i enjoy in this movie is stuff that she didn't even come up with there are so many little extra moments for the characters that are brilliant i see this as an alfonso corone film he's not transphobic as far as i know so why should i ignore his work in the work of other people who helped make this movie work as well as it does doesn't seem fair to me anyway this movie owns go watch it if you haven't 9 out of 10 next movie harry potter 4 is it's decent it's fine i guess controversial opinion incoming this is where the cracks really start to form for the series now like the last one a lot of people would probably say that this is their favorite and i used to think that way too but nowadays i don't like it as much which is kind of weird as for the story this is basically a shonen tournament arc which is pretty fun and exciting and i think as far as the plot goes this is like the more exciting story on paper harry is entered into this huge tournament against his will and he has to find a way to beat the challenges and unravel a mystery mostly on his own before a lot of harry's adventures were influenced and assisted by other characters but here he has to start figuring out things on his own and i do think that's pretty cool this is especially evident in the climax of this movie for instance in the first movie harry brings his two new bffs into the final battle with him and in the second one he just brings ron in the third one he brings just hermione and in this one he's on his own and i really like that i love a lot of things about this final battle but i'll get into that later first let's talk about a lot of the things that i don't really like in this movie firstly cedric diggory is really lame i'm sorry robert pattinson i think cedric is severely underwritten in this story that goes for the book and the movie i genuinely think harry and cedric should have been super chummy super best friends in this story his relationship with ron is pretty strained up until ron just randomly decides to stop being an [ __ ] oh and i should mention ron is like a huge dick from this point onward he stops being nice for like the rest of the series he goes from being a super loyal best bro who has harry's best interest in mind to a weird petty spiteful [ __ ] there are a lot of scenes where he's just a [ __ ] [ __ ] victor's gone to go and get drinks she cares join us no i would not care to join you and the victim they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but you just can't get into it because they would never understand but what if we made this the point of the story what if harry starts to replace ron with cedric and then cedric gets killed in the end making us really [ __ ] sad and then harry has to go back to his friend and be comforted by him when cedric dies in the end it doesn't really hit us until later when cedric's dad is crying people say this scene is sad but i don't think it's that sad because i don't really care about cedric that much this is the turning point of the entire series and it could definitely be more powerful another huge problem i have with this story in particular is mad-eye moody see this is where jk starts making her stories complex for literally no reason she has definitely gone too far in a few places the entire barty crouch subplot is stupid as [ __ ] i just do not give a [ __ ] about any of the scenes that feature barty crouch and cornelius fudge these [ __ ] names i swear to god i mean this is a story where harry is in a [ __ ] anime tournament he has a face off against a sexy french girl and a hard-boiled russian super soldier and [ __ ] batman but half of the story is devoted to the crouch family this also completely destroys the character of mad-eye moody moody is given so much characterization in this story except we learn that this isn't the real mad eye moody it's [ __ ] wizard nazi doctor who pretending to be mad imoody and after they arrest him we're left with regular moody who we don't even know because we never met him so when he shows up in the later movies we don't even care because we don't know who he is and when he dies off screen we super don't care if you remove the crouch plotline and just leave moody as normal mad-eye moody it doesn't really change the story that much just say that [ __ ] peter pettigrew put harry's name in the goblet of fire he can already sneak in and out of the castle and he's a character that we already know and hate she keeps inventing new characters and new villains just to get rid of them after one story i think part of the reason why people love bellatrix so much is because she actually sticks around for more than one story in a long epic adventure fantasy series it's nice to have villains that we can grow a relationship with as well moody would have been so much more interesting if this was really him i like the idea of a genius teacher who's pretty hard on the students but still has their best interests in mind i love the scene where he triggers neville's ptsd and then he realizes he went too far so he offers to give him some tea and hang out with him oh wait sorry that's not really moody it's just nazi david tennant pulling neville aside so he can trick him later that's stupid neville doesn't need to be tricked into helping harry find a magical plant neville already likes magical plants and he likes helping harry he would have done it on his own do you think that miserable oath would have led you into the woods if i hadn't suggested it what the [ __ ] does that even mean you're telling me hagrid wouldn't have shown harry the dragons hagrid loves to show harry magical animals he does it all the time also this leads into my next point while i like the idea of there being illegal spells avada kadavra is the dumbest [ __ ] spell in the entire series all of the other forbidden spells make perfect sense to me mind control spell yeah that's [ __ ] up that should be illegal torture spell yeah that's [ __ ] up that should be illegal spell that kills someone now your gut reaction might be to say that yeah that spell should be illegal but lots of spells kill people in this universe what spell is this it looks kind of evil not an illegal spell though this spell [ __ ] kills people not illegal though the difference is that other spells are actually creative too avada kadavra just stops you from being alive it's lame as [ __ ] and it removes so much creativity from the series the later duels just revolve around one person shooting the evil green laser and a good guy shooting the good guy red laser the best fight in the entire series is only cool because voldemort realizes he can't rely on his dumb ass murder laser it's two wizards actually using cool creative spells to try to kill each other oh but this spell isn't illegal it looks like it should be [ __ ] illegal what the [ __ ] even is this he's shooting him with the power of evil why isn't that illegal oh and this point kind of sits on its own and i'm gonna upset some of you with this one but i do not think emma watson is very good at acting she suits hermione just fine but hermione is kind of a caricature a lot of the time are you done having your tantrum her line delivery sometimes is just kind of off like she's always [ __ ] yelling at people even when it's not appropriate wake up wake up bloody hell honestly get dressed also i hate how she like acts with her eyebrows i don't know who told her to do this but it's really distracting once you start to notice it all of this is frustrating to me because this seriously should be the coolest harry potter movie it has so much potential but it's being dragged down by this overly complicated plot and this extra needless world building this is jk rowling's biggest failing as an author she thinks she's smarter than she is a story being more complex does not mean it's better harry potter is best when it's simple the concept of a little orphan boy becoming a strong powerful wizard with a lot of friends is really simple and it catches us immediately but as the story keeps going she keeps adding [ __ ] that we do not care about and it starts to muddy up the concepts that we fell in love with but that isn't to say that this one doesn't still have stuff that i like and i'm gonna say that with like all of the movies that i don't like in this series but like i said i don't hate this movie i think it's decent it's just that the problems in this one are starting to become more apparent i personally don't think harry potter as a character is as lame as people think he is i like that he's just brave as hell in all of these movies remember how he accepts his [ __ ] death in the second movie he's 12 years old and he's willing to give his life to save someone else i think that's pretty cool when i see a little kid pushing himself to do something even though he's really afraid that's when i start to consider it a strong character trait if there's one thing you can criticize harry for it's that he's kind of a dick sometimes and in the books this is kind of shown to be just childhood angst but in the movies it doesn't really feel like that most of the time it just feels like he's a rude person no offense but i really don't care they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine oh and this isn't really a critique but i think it's really funny whenever harry screams in these movies i know that sounds weird but i don't know how to explain it i just think he yells really funny he just has like a funny yell [Applause] but on the end of actually praising harry i like how his personal arc is developing in this movie in particular and this arc continues into the fifth movie where i think he's the strongest and the most developed in this one he has to fully accept that he's gotten as far as he has just because of the help he's received from other people and this one he's getting bullied he can't really rely on ron and hermione and i love how he decides to use his own personal skill with the broom to beat the dragon challenge it's cool how all the challenges rely on the contestants to use their own methods to win but i do wish they showed other characters beating their challenges again it's a lot of missed potential it's very disappointing i will say i really do like the climax of this movie though this movie culminates in the full return of voldemort and this is where the entire series hits a turning point before this it was very much a whimsical childlike fantasy after this point everything [ __ ] sucks and this is also big because we haven't seen voldemort's true form yet and i think he looks [ __ ] awesome it helps too that ray finds is doing a very good performance as voldemort i really like how this feels like the most [ __ ] situation harry has ever gotten into i also like how harry is reasonably afraid when he realizes how screwed he is but again he's brave as [ __ ] and he decides that if he's going down he's going down swinging you can tell that he's just forcing himself to be brave in the face of a situation that he has no hope of coming out of alive i just really love this moment for harry this is probably one of my favorite moments for the character all together and one more thing i should bring up is that this movie has the most tonally dissonant ending out of all the movies every single movie except for two of them decide to try to end in an optimistic way even if it doesn't fit and this is the one where it feels the most forced right after we mourn the death of a child the tone kind of just goes back to being happy for the ending the entire status quo of this universe has shifted we cannot end the movie with the joke anymore it just doesn't work i think we'll never just have a quiet year hogwarts ron our friend [ __ ] died anyway this movie isn't that bad but for some reason even though i've seen it a million times and i've liked it for most of my life i've noticed a lot of things that i didn't really like this time around the tournament is cool in concept but the slice of life school drama isn't really paced very well and the story doesn't really feel satisfying to unravel like some of the other mysteries of ben so it might be kind of controversial but i'm gonna have to give this one a six out of ten okay those are the first four movies in the harry potter series and we have another four to go and the last half of the movies are really miserable merry christmas [Music] so [Music] you

Twitter: https://twitter.com/cosmovarietyhr",in my last video we talked about the Lord of the Rings trilogy widely accepted to be the greatest film Trilogy ever made it's Oscar award-winning influential respected and loved by all ask anybody who's seen these movies in nine times out of ten they'll tell you that they love them and honestly there's only one thing wrong with these movies they're owned by Warner Brothers Warner Brothers was like damn that property we own that's loved and respected by all let's [ __ ] it up and try to make some more money and obviously they were trying to make a Hobbit movie work for years they even had Guillermo del Toro signed on to direct it honestly a perfect choice they really it seems like it's a pretty good idea so far I mean it's the prequel to The Series right but then Del Toro dropped out but now Peter Jackson is back to take over and he he did a good job the first time but then the greed set in the powers that be wanted to recapture the magic of the original trilogy and how did they want to do this well not by giving the director extends time and resources to create their Vision now they decided to force it to be a Trilogy why'd they go and do that now in case you didn't know The Hobbit is a single book and it's not very long and it isn't particularly complex and when I heard this would be multiple movies I was very confused because unlike the original trilogy I've actually read The Hobbit and I love it it's a lovely little character study and Bilbo Baggins is one of my favorite fictional characters one thing that I think everybody can agree on is that this book doesn't really fit into a Trilogy maybe you can make it work in two movies but three is insane so how do you fill up that much time with so little material well I'll tell you how you make [ __ ] up for comparison the first dune book is about 188 000 words and that story fits pretty well into two movies I know the second one isn't out yet but having read the book it's a safe bet on what's going to be in it in comparison The Hobbit is 95 000 words and they decided to make it into three movies this is even funnier when you consider the fact that Fellowship is about double that and it only needed one movie so when people say well The Hobbit was you know it's got too much going on it needs more than one movie I disagree because there's already an animated Hobbit movie and it's actually pretty good it's way better than the animated Lord of the Rings movie and it does a decent job of fitting everything into 90 minutes that's all killer no filler if they gave Peter Jackson three hours and one movie I really think he would have done just fine but now one movie wasn't enough we want to recapture the magic of the Oscar award-winning Trilogy and the resulting films are let's just say certainly different it's obnoxious thing I've ever experienced in my life many people say when you watch The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the first time it feels like they get better and better with each movie I would say The Hobbit movies are the opposite they kind of feel like they get a little worse they start off fine but by the end the story is completely made up of needless [ __ ] the movies are so bloated because they had to just make up a bunch of new [ __ ] to make it a Trilogy so let's Dive Right In and see how Shameless these movies truly are so this movie stars Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins a normal dude who just wants to get high and eat muffins all day and then a mysterious wizard shows up at his house and says hey I need you to come with me you're gonna go with these dwarves to kick a dragon out of their house and Bilbo's like I don't really want to do that but he does it anyway and that's basically the plot of The Hobbit it's very simple and for what it's worth this first movie isn't really that bad because it kind of just sticks to the book at least for the most part and it does have a lot of issues but those issues become more prevalent later so firstly I'm going to be nice I'm going to talk about what I like and the number one thing is Bilbo The Hobbit Martin Freeman is perfect as a younger Bilbo he encapsulates the character so well I love all of his regular dude mannerisms and even when these movies are at their lowest point if Bilbo has a scene it's usually the best scene in the movie because this is like the premier Fish Out of Water story it's about a normal guy in abnormal circumstances and Martin Freeman has been playing that role for his whole career so honestly he makes for a perfect Bilbo in the best scenes in The Hobbit book are the ones where Bilbo is alone and has to solve a problem and the best parts of these movies are those very same moments Bilbo's game with Gollum is the best scene in this movie it's just two solid performances bouncing off of each other and now the problem lies in the fact that outside of this movie Bilbo is not really the main character of the trilogy and the thing is Bilbo's entire character Arc from the book where he learns not to be a stick in the mud and he learns to take in the adventure and become a little hero it's all just in this first movie for some reason the story speed runs his development and by the end of the first movie he is done with his entire character Arc so for two sequels Bilbo is just kind of there hanging out with dwarves that definitely don't have any development of their own yeah I should probably talk about all the dwarves accompanying Bilbo on his quest are 13 dwarves who want to reclaim their Mountain home from the evil dragon and while let's say calling them characters is well let's say it's a little dishonest and you might think well how the hell are you supposed to characterize 13 dwarves and I mean it's actually not hard to do you're telling me that in three movies it's too hard to characterize 13 dwarves in The Original Trilogy we have nine main characters that's not that far off from 13. we don't need full character arcs for all of them in The Lord of the Rings trilogy Legolas doesn't have much of a character Arc but he's still a beloved character alternatively I have no idea what this guy's name is I don't know his personality or his character traits and he's in all three movies and I don't expect every dwarf to matter right away but across three movies I at least expect to feel something when they start getting killed off and in the original book knowing that there's 13 dwarves doesn't really distract you because you can't see them on screen in a movie it's way more distracting when every scene has me thinking who the [ __ ] is that guy like honestly tell me what this dwarf's name is I'll give you five seconds his name is Beaufort Beaufort is not and this is a personal gripe but some of the dwarves don't look like dwarves and I don't like that dwarves need big old beards it's the worst with Thorin I get it they wanted to make him look like Aragorn they want him to be sexy I don't care I don't like it he needs more beard I don't look at this guy and see the leader of the dwarves I see a sexy fantasy hero man like look at this and tell me which one of these two characters is a dwarf it's this one the regular guy but anyway the beginning of this movie tries to do the same thing that the previous Lord of the Rings films do he wants to start with some background set the tone and it does it very badly I commended Fellowship for packing a lot of exposition into a well-cut montage I really appreciate brevity but in this it's just an extended flashback and honestly this is all stuff that could have been told to us naturally over the course of the movie this movie covers less information in a clunkier way the intro road to Fellowship is eight minutes the intro to The Hobbit is 15 minutes so yeah not really the best start it's a little disappointing considering how much I love the opening scenes from the previous Trilogy and another thing that comes with the territory of any prequel is that the movie loves to remind you of things that you may remember from the other movies remember when Gandalf used his spooky voice at a thematically appropriate moment well now he just does it again and no it's not thematically appropriate he's just doing it because you remember he did it in the other movie and remember the soundtrack from those movies well they're mostly reused here there aren't really that many new compositions and it's a shame because the few that were made specifically for this movie are really good like the dwarf theme song is one of the best and most fitting themes in the whole series but other than that and a few other compositions we got to use music that people remember Thorin is about to make an epic Last Stand but let's just throw in the ring wraith song [Music] the song about evil ghosts you know this song has lyrics right and the lyrics don't match and the special effects really are a shadow of their former glory to start off everything is green screen now even them riding horses outside is green screen there's also that Infamous story about Ian McKellen breaking down in tears on set because he was forced to perform all alone in this green prison oh okay it was so distressing enough pudding and difficult that I thought I don't want to make this film if this is what I'm going to have to do and for some reason everything has this weird glossy glow and it kind of makes everything look cheap it's especially bad when they bring in one of the actors from the other movies and they have to add this SnapChat filter over their faces to soften their wrinkles look how weird Frodo looks and don't you worry we get to see this very same effect in every movie really the most disappointing aspect of the effects is that the production team did not have access to the mountains of props and practical assets again I don't want to blame PJ for everything he just didn't have the resources to make this Trilogy the same way he did before so now they just have to rely on CGI and it's such a bummer the Orcs look so good in the original trilogy every one of them looks so unique and now they're all CGI and you gotta look at the Orcs for a long time because they are really he pushed into this narrative because in The Hobbit book the Orcs aren't really that big of a deal they're just one of many temporary roadblocks for the group but hey we gotta add conflict and again I'm gonna get more into that in the next movie because as much as I'm bitching a lot of these problems don't become big problems until the next one the positive aspects of this film do make it easier to ignore these things and there are a lot of positive aspects at this point in the trilogy there isn't a ton of made up original content a lot of what happens is stuff that happened in the book and that's usually when these movies are good I mean a lot of the dialogue from the opening scenes are just straight up lifted from the books this movie has a lot of nice moments with Gandalf and Bilbo as well who I think are probably the strongest characters in the trilogy a lot of the childlike Adventure that you'd expect from The Hobbit is present here for the most part this movie does have a much lighter tone than the rest of the Lord of the Rings and I love that they actually sing the songs further adding to the storybook Vibe and I like that the action is fun and inventive I really appreciate that the dwarves don't fight like any other characters that we've seen before they have their own little style for instance the fellowship members each fight in a way that's very specific to each individual Gimli just smashes through his enemies like a barbarian because that makes sense for him Aragorn is like a man at Arms he can fight with like anything he uses a lot of improvised weapons showing that you can give him anything to fight with and he's equally dangerous and then we have Legolas who's the [ __ ] anime character but the dwarves all fight with each other they throw weapons to each other they do little combos it's like a [ __ ] fighting game it's very creative and most importantly it suits them we see this as early on as the scene where they're doing the dishes the fact that they do chores in the same way that they kill monsters that's very smart it's a good detail I really wish this wasn't the only way we saw their character shine through but I'll take it this movie also has a lot of creative visuals I like the transition between old Bilbo and young Bilbo and I really like how the logo Has a Little Smoke Ring behind it emulating the one ring there are also a few narrative choices that I think work a little better here I like that Bilbo has the chance to decide if he wants to go on the adventure or not he has to make the active choice and I think that's a lot better for his character Arc I also like that they make a point to show that Bilbo really likes hanging out with the elves and he doesn't need to say out loud boy I love it here you can just tell by looking at him in these short scenes where he's just vibing and it makes sense because later in his life Bilbo does go on to live with the elves little details like this it didn't need to be added but they make the overall picture a little better I also like the goblin song [Music] I think goblins should be in every movie so yeah this is definitely the easiest Hobbit movie to enjoy because a lot of the things that people hate about these movies are either not a big deal yet or they just haven't been added yet to me this is the only time that any of these movies feel like they're a part of The Lord of the Rings franchise so I'm gonna give this one an okay out of 10. let's get to the real [ __ ] now [Music] I think I hate this movie bad mood but watching this movie made me cranky any hope I may have had for this Trilogy has completely been washed away if you ask me this is where these movies really start to show their true colors because like I said the last movie already covered Bilbo's entire character Arc and unfortunately we don't really have a lot of ground for this story to cover being the middle chunk of the book this movie only has a few story beats to adapt the only things that happen in this part of the book are the following the dwarves get captured by spiders the dwarves get arrested by Elves and the dwarves go to the mountain that's it we don't even kill smog in this movie we just need to meet him now that's not a lot of stuff for a story so this is where PJ and the team really started making [ __ ] up in the last movie they really only added the new orc bad guy and a few other details but that's not enough we need more OC in the original story Gandalf leaves the group periodically on the adventure because he's a wizard and he's mysterious and he's got [ __ ] to do he's also way too strong so he'd solve their problems a little too quickly but hey we need content for the movie so let's ruin the mystery and just see what he was doing so in this movie he's hunting The Necromancer who's secretly Sauron yeah Sauron isn't a [ __ ] thing in The Hobbit and there's a number of reasons why this doesn't work for me first of all the Hobbit is not Lord of the Rings The Hobbit is a silly goofy bedtime fairy tale The Hobbit is basically a collection of bedtime stories that Tolkien would tell his kids and it does read like that this is the tale of how Bilbo saved the dwarves from the trolls this is how Bilbo saved the dwarves from The Spiders this is how Bilbo saved the dwarves from prison but Papa can the dwarves do anything on their own no and Tolkien didn't really have the Lord of the Rings fully ironed out when he wrote The Hobbit the one ring was just a cool magic ring that Bilbo found and later he retcon didn't made it way more important and that works but when you read the book it's just kind of a ring they don't talk about how it's literally the most evil thing ever made they don't talk talk about the Dark Lord that created it that would ruin the vibe because this is a fun bedtime fairy tale but you have other prizes the ring oh yes I'll keep it as a souvenir in a glass box and the mantle so here's the issue unfortunately we made the Epic dark bloody violent heart-wrenching fantasy Trilogy before we made the predecessor so instead of committing to making The Hobbit they tried to just turn The Hobbit into Lord of the Rings we needed to be a Trilogy and we need world-ending threats this Trilogy is constantly trying to balance the childlike fantasy Whimsy of the book with [ __ ] like this you might think this is a small scale Adventure the dwarves and Bilbo go to the mountain to stop the dragon and get their home back but no now in this Trilogy this is one of the most important things that's ever happened and for that reason Sauron needs to get involved he's just here because walso runs the bad guy in Lord of the Rings and this is the Lord of the Rings prequel oh [ __ ] hold on the executives gave us notes they said we need even more characters uh I don't know I mean we have 13 dwarves can we give some of them character no uh okay uh Legolas is here now people like Legolas right I mean I guess people like Legolas but here's my hot take for this video I think he's the worst Fellowship member out of all of the movies he's easily the least compelling of all of them he barely has any lines he kind of just sits around making the same face like bro you are literally about to die could you pretend to care and I've heard he's better in the books and that's cool that's fine but I don't read books for nerds I read books for grown-ups and I give Orlando Bloom a pass on this Trilogy because he was a kid this was his first gig and I've seen him do better but he is not better in The Hobbit he's really [ __ ] Bland I wouldn't even say it's fully his fault they didn't really give him anything to do other than fight and uh we also got to throw some CGI on his face because it's been like a decade since we've seen this guy why are you [ __ ] here man you're so old where's your wife go home to your family dude oh hold on Warner said we need more new characters I mean again we have 13 [ __ ] dwarves okay fine whatever Kate for from Lost is here now she's an all-new original character her name is toriel and you know what fine The Hobbit has literally zero women in this story it's kind of a sausage fest I'm not even fully against adding someone new but you may wonder what her role in this story may be no you won't you will never wonder that because from her first scene you know that she is here to be a dwarf's love interest it is immediately apparent that she is just here to be in a love triangle and you know when I read The Hobbit I thought to myself this is pretty good but it really needs a love triangle I could have anything down my trousers or nothing that was a dick joke in the Lord of the Rings just imagine Tolkien reading that part to his kids and really the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring at least the last movie wasn't dull this movie is like unbearable especially if you're watching the Extended Cut if you're wondering the Extended Cut adds extra scenes for the human characters like the mayor and Alfred Who's Alfred oh don't worry we'll get to Alfred later the only time this movie tries to Ward away our boredom is in the infamous Barrel sequence now the biggest problem with the action scenes in this Trilogy is that they kind of just don't know when to quit I liked the goblin escape from the last movie at first after a while it just keeps going and it keeps getting more outlandish and it gets to the point where it doesn't even feel like a movie anymore it feels like a set piece from an Uncharted game and the major set piece in this movie is the barrel scene in the book Bilbo and the dwarves ride barrels down on the river to escape the elves and that's it but in this movie no no that's not enough so now we have to have the Orcs show up and try to kill the dwarves and we also have the elves show up and they want to stop the dwarves but they also hate Orcs a little bit more so it's just a cluster [ __ ] of people fighting each other and then for some reason there's like shitty GoPro footage it's like we're on Splash Mountain and really the most distracting thing about these action sequences is that your suspension of disbelief is just completely destroyed the characters in this movie are Immortal they survive the most insane [ __ ] and as a result there's rarely ever any tension in this movie and that's kind of one of the biggest problems about prequels we know Legolas isn't gonna die we know Bilbo isn't gonna die and that's not to say you can't have tension in a movie where we know the outcome we all know that Gollum isn't gonna eat Bilbo but that doesn't mean that that scene isn't intense because the scene is Well written it was written by someone who knows what he's [ __ ] doing so the longer you draw out these scenes where the characters are never in any Peril and they never take any damage it just kind of makes me not care why would I give a [ __ ] if they're never met with any sort of Roadblock and after this we get a long stretch of very boring plot I was actually really surprised to see how much movie is left at this point because nothing happens in this part of the movie but hey we gotta stretch everything out past two hours and yes I do think it's a very good idea to make Bard a real character because he's ultimately gonna be the guy who kills the dragon it doesn't hurt to give him something more to do in this movie but I don't really need to devote more screen time to seeing his family drama I don't need to see his rivalry with the mayor and I don't need to see pointless Shenanigans with the mayor and his man's servant again we will get to him later but after all that [ __ ] Bilbo and the dwarves finally [ __ ] go to the mountain and we can get our one scene that's mostly good Bilbo and Smaug much like the last movie the best scene is the one that they lifted directly from the book where Bilbo talks to a monster it's more or less the same exact seed from the book and because of that it stands out as being good I do think it's hilarious just how into this role Benedict Cumberbatch was they had my man in a mocap suit grinding his coochie on the ground it looks hilarious but I gotta give him props he is giving 200 percent effort to playing a dragon I gotta respect that it's kind of interesting because this footage let the effects team create a pretty good model for smog in this scene but I think that this was the only scene they had that mocap for because later in the movie for some reason smog just kind of looks like [ __ ] like look at this shot this is straight up unfinished CGI at his worst he looks like the dragon from Merlin and as good as this scene with Smog and Bilbo is scenes like this remind me that we don't really spend a lot of time with smog in this Trilogy and stretching him out into the next movie where all he has to do is die it's just kind of weird and anti-climactic they had Doctor Strange grinding his [ __ ] and balls against the floor for this we can devote more screen time to Alfred and the mayor but we can't give smog a little more to work with again this should have just been two movies you can just have smog be a small but effective footnote in a larger story because with all this padding the climax of this movie is just a bunch of scenes that were made up because there's no climax in this part of the story there is no epic battle of Helms Deep so the final Conflict of the movie is this the dwarves decide to confront smog which they don't do in the book but you know what I get it make the main characters confront the enemy it's fine I can accept this however their master plan involves dowsing smog in molten gold and it's just another one of those extended action video game sequences where our characters are immortal total and can pull off insane Feats the fact that smog can't kill a handful of dwarves makes him seem much less intimidating also this looks like [ __ ] but don't worry because this isn't the only conflict we have in the climax while all of that is happening we have feelie Keeley Owen and Beaufort Deez Nuts in Lake Town even though they aren't supposed to be there they're here because earlier Keeley got a wound from a morgul arrow yes the [ __ ] evil Enchanted metal that makes Frodo almost die and turn into a ring wraith the stuff that the elite ghoul King uses now we are just giving it to normal Orcs so the regular orc shot Keeley and now he's dying so Sauron sends Orcs to go finish off the dwarves because he thinks Thorin and the dwarves are in Lake town now first of all I just have to say I don't know why Sauron has beef with a couple of [ __ ] dwarves I feel like he'd have bigger [ __ ] on his mind and even though the mountain that Thorne's company wants to get to is right next to Lake town and logically it's the next place the dwarves would want to go that is not where the bad guys look oh and also Legolas and toriel show up to help so now the dwarves that aren't supposed to be here have to fight off the Orcs that aren't supposed to be here with help from a guy who isn't even in this book and a woman who is made up for this story solely so one of the dwarves could have a hot elf girlfriend and the elves that aren't supposed to be here have to heal the dwarf that isn't supposed to be here because he has a magic evil wound that he shouldn't have because the bad guys weren't supposed to be here had evil magic weapons that they weren't supposed to be given by the bad guy who isn't even in this story oh and uh also who the [ __ ] is that guy and it would be one thing if any of this made-up content was interesting but it's not in the last video I didn't really complain about the changes they made in the movies because the changes made for a better overall picture I don't care about changes I care when the changes are made out of desperation to add artificial conflict and bring in characters purely for fan service and to stretch out a movie way past its run time these changes aren't done in service of a better story they are done to make the movie longer Legolas and Sauron being in this Trilogy adds nothing to the story of Bilbo Baggins The Hobbit I don't even think Bilbo meets Legolas and this movie really made me realize just how [ __ ] this Trilogy is it doesn't feel anything like the source material and it doesn't even feel like it belongs with the overall Series in my last video I spent a lot of time praising the simple and effective aspects of Storytelling in the original trilogy and it's because of stuff like this it's clearly not easy to Pace a three hour movie appropriately even the guy who did it well three times in a row can't keep it up under these circumstances so yeah this movie stinks I don't like it and I don't think I'll ever watch it again so I'm gonna give it a bad out of 10. let's see if things can get any worse so at last we are at the final film The Last Lord of the Rings movie we've ever gotten and honestly it's just about as bad as the last one I've actually never seen this movie up until I made this video I was not convinced that it would be worth my time so I have not watched it until today and I couldn't even rent this movie I had to [ __ ] buy it I own this now wait a minute rated R for kids now if I said the last movie doesn't have a lot of things to adapt this is the one where they really took it too far because the entirety of this section of the book is just smog dying immediately and then Bilbo sleeping through the final battle so like how do you make that into a movie this movie basically exists to resolve all of the threads of made up [ __ ] that they've laid out so to start things off smog dies right before the title drops and now the dwarves got their Mountain back that's so nice but everybody's kind of mad at about it so now they have to have a battle for an entire movie so here are the main players the Five Armies are as follows Army number one the dwarves and Bilbo like I said Bilbo's kind of not supposed to really be a factor in this battle in the book tolki makes a point to show that this whole conflict is stupid I simply do not understand war and yeah Bilbo doesn't sleep through the whole thing but he really doesn't have much to do in this movie there's a certain point in this movie where I forgot Bilbo was in it I just want to remind you real quick in case you don't know that this movie is called The Hobbit now with the Dragon Slain the dwarves are finally finished with their Quest they got their home back isn't that nice no it's not nice because now Thorin is infected with something called Dragon sickness ocean Madness he loves his gold and he wants it all for himself but everybody else wants the gold too it's the Middle Earth Gold Rush baby see you remember how the corrupting influence of the Ring was shown to us naturally over the course of the other Trilogy yeah [ __ ] that let's invent a [ __ ] made-up fantasy disease that makes him act crazy and kind of gay okay fine you win with your gay stuff that's what you want right to win and none of the dwarves are really happy about this nobody here is having a good time and wait why is Bilbo taller than him Army number two is the elves who have this ancient beef with the dwarves Lee Pace is the king of the elves and he wants this gay little necklace that Thorin has and Thorn's like hey it's my necklace you can't have it so now the elves want to do a war disclaimer this necklace is only shown and talked about once in this movie and then we never hear about it or see it ever again and along with the elves we have the stupid [ __ ] love triangle between the elf that isn't in this story Keely the dwarf and another elf that isn't supposed to be here Keeley just professed his love tutorial after knowing her for like a day I think it's been like a day but he tells her he loves her and he gives her a precious gift [Music] and that's not good because Legolas is in love with her too because uh because he Army number three is the CGI Orcs the big bad White Orc has this ongoing grudge match with Thorin and the other one has beef with Legolas because they like fought in the last movie or something I don't know they just really need stuff for Legolas to do I don't know what to tell you they want in on the battle too and they're being told to do this by Sauron who again I can't stress this enough why is he here don't you have [ __ ] to do army number four is the humans they just got their Town [ __ ] wrecked by smog so Bard goes up to Thorin and he's like hey Thorin since you woke up the dragon and you ruined our home could we have like a little bit of cash and Bilbo is like yeah Thorin we did make a deal with them how about we give our good friends some money and thorin's like [ __ ] that [ __ ] so yeah this subplot would have been fine it makes the most sense Bard did go out of his way to help the dwarves and now Thorn's being a [ __ ] dick so of course they'd be mad at them this mostly makes perfect sense except for some reason the human storyline is Tainted by [ __ ] Alfred he's like some comic relief grima Worm tongue he's the most annoying [ __ ] character out of all of the movies in the entire series he's not funny he's not interesting he has more lines than a majority of the [ __ ] dwarves and his inclusion in the story makes no sense he doesn't do anything in this story he doesn't teach anybody a lesson he doesn't affect the plot he just acts like a [ __ ] [ __ ] he soaks up all the screen time and then he dies and those are all the armies all four four of them uh wait a minute I mean in the book The Wolves are the Fifth Army but there aren't any wolves in this oh wait there's a second orc Army too there's like the main one and there's another one that never really joins the battle so is that the Fifth Army they didn't really battle so are they part of the Battle of the Five Armies oh wait now the Eagles are here too and they deal with those other Orcs are they the Fifth Army or the sixth Army so depending on how you slice it this is either the battle of the four five or six armies one of the biggest problems with this movie is that the Battle of the Five Armies is stupid it's a stupid battle that happens for a stupid reason and even Tolkien admits as much hence why it is only covered for a few pages in the book Bilbo is not even conscious for it and in this movie it is the longest on-screen War of the Rings battle out of all of the movies it condenses everything that made all of the battles in the original trilogy memorable and it throws all that [ __ ] in the trash this is basically just a CGI football game Tolkien despised war and he wrote the story to reflect that and I actually like how the animated Hobbit movie handles it Bilbo is just like wow this is stupid I'm sitting this [ __ ] out and this movie has many moments where the characters are like wow this whole conflict is really stupid but they still spend two hours on Mindless video game action and I'm sorry but you can't have an entire fantasy action movie be about an event that all of the characters admit is stupid and pointless the movie is actively telling you not to care and I mean it when I say it's a [ __ ] video game like right at the beginning of the movie Gandalf got kidnapped by Sauron and he got put in a bird cage but it's okay because the [ __ ] Avengers show up and save him and they have this insane battle with these Dark Souls at bees and I think this scene is what finally broke me the way it's framed to be so badass and epic with Elrod getting this action movie one-liner you should have stayed dead and the CGI ghosts just look so bad I I just I don't know see to me I thought I was gonna get a Hobbit movie and when I got to this scene I realized this is no longer an adaptation of The Hobbit this is something completely different and I complained before about my suspension of disbelief but this movie takes it to another level for instance Bard escapes from prison in the beginning of this movie by taking a rope dangling outside the window because his prison is conveniently located above the lake he then ties the Rope to the mayor who just so happens to be passing underneath and the mayor didn't notice because he also just so happened to be pushing Alfred off of the boat at this exact moment then he dangles for a second before getting caught against the boat and I guess the speed of the boat and the sheer girth of the mayor allow for the entire wall to be pulled off like what and then we have the most infamous scene of them all where Legolas has to get to toriel before she gets killed but he's all the way up in this Tower so right before toriel is struck with the killing blow he hops off of the tower stabs a troll in the head which then in its death throws knocks over the tower which topples perfectly in place to create a bridge that legless could use to go save her then they fight on the bridge which crumbles and then we get this beautiful moment [Music] I need help reacting to something this is officially too far this is a [ __ ] video game if something crazy happened once or twice I wouldn't really fixate on it because don't get me wrong Lord of the Rings can be over the top but it's usually done within reason in the original trilogy Legolas is the only guy who does the crazy stuff and even then the craziest thing that he does is played off comedically because even the movie knows it's insane but in this Trilogy everybody is a [ __ ] superhero the death defying stunts are Bountiful and for some reason it feels like every character gets a heroic moment to save someone from being killed toriel is about to be killed oh no but it's okay Legolas is here to save her and right after that Thorne's about to be killed oh no but it's okay because Legolas saves him and Bard's kids are about to be killed oh no but it's okay because Bard shows up to save them and toriel is about to be killed again oh no but it's okay because because Keeley shows up to save her and like dude this is just artificial tension I'm not stupid you've done this same scene like five times it's just two hours of mind-numbing action there's no rise and fall in the pacing it's just a straight line the only reason I'd say this isn't the worst one in the trilogy is because I could not stop laughing I legitimately had my jaw on the floor for some of these scenes and yes this Trilogy is very disappointing but if you compare it to save the Star Wars prequels I don't think they ever really get to that level being the worst Lord of the Rings movie still puts them higher than a lot of other bad movies I've watched on this channel the stuff with Bilbo is always great and the performances are actually not that bad like even when the script is [ __ ] the actors are all working their asses off though I do mean it when I say this script is bad there are some lines that nobody could save why does it hurt so much because it was and I really like this one little scene where Bilbo and Gandalf are just chilling after the battle's over and if you ask me there needed to be a lot more scenes like this because I've been saying this a lot and you can call me old-fashioned but I think the Hobbit movies should have been about the [ __ ] Hobbit it is truly the biggest failure of this Trilogy I don't care how much [ __ ] you make up if Bilbo was more involved I probably would accept it I understand wanting to make The Hobbit movies connect to the original trilogy adding stuff with Sauron and making the ring more important because that's what everybody expects when they think of The Hobbit because it's the prequel to The Lord of the Rings but here's the thing The Hobbit is not the prequel to The Lord of the Rings it's kind of its own story that just so happens to have some connecting tissue with the story that comes after and I really struggle to consider this a Hobbit movie as this Trilogy stands it's kind of just Lord of the Rings fan fiction and a lot of you wanted me to watch that new Amazon show for this video and I don't wanna that's just more fan fiction I have no interest I'm sorry I think I might be done with Lord of the Rings for a little bit my childhood isn't exactly ruined but I don't think it was improved very much either so I'm gonna give this one a dumb out of 10. you know every year I make these videos and every year they put me in a bad mood you guys want a ranking you want me to rank all the movies fine you ready for this from worst to best number three these two pieces of [ __ ] they suck number two this movie it's fine it didn't make me that mad number one everything else just watch these it's all you need I'm done with prequel Society has progressed past the need for prequels I'm tired next December we're doing all the Batman movies bye-bye [Music] it's upside down of course it spells Gucci yeah he was quite kind of kept me in check a little bit no no my boy no no yes that was what they used to call me Gandalf the gay [Music] as soon as somebody gets remotely boring it just freezes a giant easy boy recliner that that's a wonderful name for Orlando easy boy recline I met for the first time the great Christopher Lee then with the the killer quite uh early on in the soup course he turned to me and he said I've always thought I should play again I'll ask that to find a mirror just take a quick glance remind myself that I am in fact Orlando Bloom please have you been having these reunions without me no yes yes the social distancing work for schmeagle and I got dollars who likes to drink disinfectant precious I don't know on the battlefields let me just tilt this up a wee bit

You can address any mail to Justin",[Music] hey guys this is zachary hello and welcome to another star wars video and before we begin a lot of my legends fans have been saying eck when are you gonna get back to legends videos and soon i've got a lot that i'm working on do not worry admittedly we have been a little cannon heavy here for the last probably couple of months but that's because of the release of the mandalorian and the high republic and all of the other stuff that's come with that today's video though comes from something that i'm doing re-watching star wars rebels and i've decided it was a good time to re-watch rebels because it's been a very very long time since i've even looked at the show to be honest i'll dive deep into it whenever there's a space battle or something else i need to cover but just generally i haven't thought a whole lot about the show since it ended and even while it was still airing i don't think i saw every episode it was before i was doing youtube full-time i kind of thought it was more for kids as i did with the clone wars and with the new shows coming out on disney plus in the future including the ahsoka series the bad batch and probably eventually a full rebel sequel series i figured now was as good a time as any to re-watch the show and i'm going to start off this video by saying something very very controversial having also re-watched the clone wars this year or i guess technically last year now in preparation for season seven i think i like star wars rebels more now admittedly i'm not all the way through rebels i'm about to start season three which of course is when thrawn comes in so you'll have to put an asterisk next to some of the stuff i say and i will i'm sure i have comments to say about thrawn after i get through his episodes again but from what i remember seasons three and four were also the strongest of the series but i'm not here to defend the fact that i like star wars rebels more than i like the clone wars that's a personal thing but i'm gonna discuss what i think makes the show really phenomenal and why it's worth a watch even if you're an adult or an older star wars fan or if you're not interested in animated tv shows and that's a point that i really understand because i didn't watch the clone wars for a while and i didn't watch star wars rebels for a while because i thought they were for kids even now i don't watch very many shows or movies that are animated and that probably comes from some inherent bias that i have which isn't really fair because there's lots of good animated stuff but it's especially hard with star wars rebels in my opinion because the art style is a little bit distracting probably the weakest part of the show for me the art style works i think in certain places space battles sometimes look really cool although the long-necked star destroyers are a bit wonky the environments look great but the characters look fairly cartoony especially when you have characters like sabine having different color hair and whatever else but all of that notwithstanding the show was worth watching and here's why i like it more than the clone wars or at least some strong suits that the show really plays up i think the biggest thing about star wars rebels that i'm appreciating more than the clone wars is how the show is structured star wars rebels follows a single crew the phoenix rebel cell now sometimes certain episodes are more focused on one character for example in season two we have an episode dedicated to zeb and kallus but this is a lot different than the clone wars tv show which was almost an anthology series some episodes would be about anakin and the 501st other episodes would take place on coruscant the story really jumped around in a lot of ways so much so that it was actually aired out of order as i'm sure many of you know and i just find with the clone wars we get a consistent storytelling through arcs but on an arc to arc basis we don't get the same level of cohesion on the other hand with star wars rebels although we do have arcs we generally also have one consistent storyline we're talking in the first two seasons especially about the ghost crew gaining up power and getting resources then later they're more directly fighting the empire the sense of cohesion does a lot for the story in my opinion and one thing is the fact that we get really attached to these characters i've heard a lot of people complain about ezra and i get that because he can be an annoying character but in my opinion he doesn't rise anywhere near the level of early clone wars ahsoka and i think the bond that he and cain inform is really really fun to explore as is the fact that the whole ghost crew is becoming a whole family and i think that family aspect of star wars rebels really makes the ending in particular hit a lot harder those last few scenes and i think that will be the main sort of thing that's holding together whatever sequel series comes out as well as shows like ahsoka i do think the relationship is helped by the plot not jumping around as much as well whereas we will have stretches of ahsoka anakin episodes in the clone wars than stretches of just clone episodes or whatever else in rebels we don't usually go too long without having a zeb ezra moment for example i do think rubble's characters are also generally pretty likable and we do take some of the best from the clone wars into the show including ahsoka rex and others and i think rebels does a good job of picking up those plots while also moving forward with a lot of its own story i like how the first few seasons for example especially season one start off with the ghost crew really just trying to survive and then in season two and beyond they become a part of this greater rebellion another thing that i like about star wars rebels and it just had me wanting to play awakening of the rebellion one of my favorite mods for empire war which i may have been showing on the screen for parts of this video is the fact that it really does a good job of showing the beginnings of this rebel cell and one of the interesting things is that the missions have a lot to do with the acquisition of assets and weapons and ships to fight the empire and personally that is something that i really really enjoy i love how in that mustafar episode as the rebels are trying to escape and those three karelian corvettes come through that it's like this holy crap moment we're being saved and we're now a part of this bigger thing and every time they steal a ship or steal gas it feels like it's being used it's kind of funny how you get attached to that in a way as a viewer like for me when i see a space battle and i see an a-wing get taken out it's a cringe-worthy moment because i know that's a ship they can't easily replace and it represents a real loss in their capabilities but on the other hand when they steal for example the quasar class it feels like a real success and something that will pay off later on and of course in the case of the quasar in particular it has its huge moment where it's sacrificed at the battle of atlanta alongside commander sato to summarize this point i think it's really cool how the show gives you all of these little missions then pays it off with the rebel fleet actually growing and becoming more powerful the rebellion grows in meaningful ways then as it does so the scope of phoenix squad's missions and their enemies that they face as well increases proportionally i also like the space battles they're minimalist in some ways but i think there's a cool movement to them that i appreciate especially when it comes to the use of cool original trilogy or ot era designs like the bra hot talk or the hammerhead or the cr90 it all just looks really good in star wars rebels but there's also a final thing that i haven't talked about that really seals this show as much watch for star wars fans for me at least that's the almost spiritual aspects of the force and of being a jedi and of just life itself that the show goes into on one hand the characters go through real pain ezra of course has to deal with the fate of his parents kanan with being one of the few surviving jedi in an order which has been wiped out but we'll see the way that the galaxy moves in order to help the light side i think culminating with the final few episodes of the series which i won't talk about in case you haven't seen the show yet so star wars rebels is great also does a good job of taking characters that we know and love and reintroducing them into the show so give rebels a try just trust me watch you know the first half of season 1 and if you don't get it at that point then drop it but also feel free to follow me on twitter i'm tweeting my impressions of the show as i watch through it as i said i'm pretty close to starting season three you can find a link to my twitter down below and i would love to hear your guys's thoughts as i watch along or re-watch along i have seen the show before but i've definitely gained a new appreciation for it this time anyway guys have a good one be safe and as always may the force be with [Music] you [Music] you

and dealt more with Ahsoka more with Captain Rex more with the Clones more with things that we weren't seeing in the movies actually felt way more like Star Wars to us so the idea of coming up with an entirely new crew of people was exactly what I wanted to do I didn't want to inherit all these histories and timelines of all these other characters we wanted it to be true to the original movies in essence but we wanted to be a different story with different characters we wanted to be a wholly original tapestry in many ways and very quickly we settled on the idea that one of the most interesting untold stories at least Untold in the movies is how do the rebel lines begin [Music] six years after the conclusion of Star Wars Rebels its impact on the franchise has certainly been felt characters from the series appeared in other mediums Concepts made its way into news stories and even tent pole Disney plus Star Wars shows are pitched to fans as a spiritual Star Wars Rebels successor whether you love Star Wars Rebels or not it's Legacy six years later still remain strong but if you were to rewind the clock nine years to the release of the first episode in 2014. you'd be surprised that this show lasted more than one season in order to get the full story of Star Wars Rebels need to go back to its predecessor Star Wars the Clone Wars [Music] foreign while an entire generation of Star Wars fans grew up on the Star Wars frequels another slightly younger generation grew up on Star Wars the Clone Wars where the prequel trilogy only had three movies to tell the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker the Clone Wars had numerous 20 episode Seasons to tell the story of this gigantic War the Clone Wars was not shy from further developing George Lucas's beloved characters Anakin Obi-Wan Padme the Jedi and even Jar Jar Binks were developed far more than anyone could have ever imagined this allowed Star Wars fans to easily get invested into the series but Dave filoni and George Lucas didn't just continue the story of the characters from the movies characters like Ahsoka Tano Captain Rex asajj Ventress and dozens of other characters became fan favorites in order to tell the story of all these characters and the battles they thought Star Wars the Clone Wars took the approach as an anthology series each season would have numerous arcs and while characters certainly developed from one Arc to another each Arc relatively speaking told its own story this allowed millions of people to experience the Clone Wars in a unique Way the show after its five season run was a major success fans all over the world had a strong love and passion for the series which is why its cancellation hurts so much Star Wars was bought by Disney and along with the acquisition came the cancellation of the Clone Wars a few episodes in a season six were luckily able to see the light of day on Netflix but others were not the Clone Wars for the time being would be a story left unfinished [Music] however shortly thereafter lucasfilm announced Dave filoni and others involved with the Clone Wars would continue working on another Star Wars series fair or not people would view this series as the show that replaced the Clone Wars the series that was so beloved by many was canceled because of this new show so this new show better be good right to battle the Empire a rebel alliance will form the Jedi will rise and you will know the power of the force Star Wars Rebels coming in 2014 to Disney XD fans were largely not pleased with this Star Wars rebels over the years Star Wars the Clone Wars greatly improved its Graphics its cinematography and its mature themes Star Wars Rebels was seen as going back to square one the decline of the visual quality from the Clone Wars to Rebels was instantly noticeable of course Rebels didn't have the budget that the Clone Wars had but that's not gonna stop Star Wars fans from complaining nonetheless the Clone Wars with its larger budget was able to take advantage of the 21-9 aspect ratio allowing more visuals to be put on this screen at once Star Wars Rebels on the other hand to save costs took the 16x9 approach allowing less visuals to be shown at once going Beyond simply the graphics many people took issue with the art style as well Star Wars Rebels was largely inspired by the Ralph Macquarie concept art of the original Star Wars Trilogy and while this excited many fans initially it turns out that once you turn that art into moving images it doesn't look as iconic designs of Stormtroopers and and Vader felt off to some Vans and the ultra thin lightsabers bothered many others as well now outside the visuals the Clone Wars often got dark and mature with its themes and portrayal of War Rebels was now going to be catered to a younger audience while the Clone Wars had fans of all different kinds its largest demographics were the kids that grew up with the prequels these kids were largely unaware of the vitriol and disdain older fans had for the prequel trilogy but Disney was certainly aware during the early days of Star Wars tenure under Disney it felt like they were avoiding anything related to the prequels like the plague a large part of the marketing of the force awakens was that this movie was going to be everything that the prequels weren't the new Battlefront game was only going to have characters and locations from the original trilogy new comics and books would be mostly set in the original trilogy era and Star Wars Rebels would be set in the Years prior to the original trilogy prequel fans felt largely left behind by this new direction of lucasfilm regardless of all this frustration 2.7 million in people tuned in for the pilot episode but a few episodes later it only retained a fifth of its viewership and even as the series progressed Rebels would never even come close to that 2.7 million viewers that tuned in on day one but as I said before in 2023 Star Wars Rebels is largely loved and its impact on the franchise is unavoidable so what happened in the nine years between the release of the pilot and the start of the Ahsoka series well hello everybody and welcome to another video my name is the gold man and today we are going to talk about Star Wars Rebels all these years later foreign the series begins with a look at Darth Vader and he pretty much summarizes what this series is going to be about there is a new generation of force users in the galaxy and the emperor fears what they can do we transitioned to a boy alone in the world staring up at the might of the Empire the series was pitched as a group of people from vastly different walks of life coming together to become a family our initial perspective is from an orphan boy who does anything he can to survive he is smart and quick on his feet but he lacks empathy he comes across the ghost crew a crew consisting of a Mandalorian girl a lasat a psychopathic Droid a twee-like pilot and a surviving Jedi This Crew isn't a part of some organized Rebellion yet they're just a group of people trying to help the disenfranchised on lothal when Ezra gets caught up with this group of people he instantly forms an attachment with the Jedi Kanan and their bond is really what season 1 is about many people struggle to describe the relationship between the Clone Wars and Rebels rebels isn't a sequel to The Clone Wars because it tells its own story that happens to have a few characters returning from the Clone Wars sure you can say it's the second show in the faloni verse but the proper term I would use is spiritual successor the Clone Wars at heart isn't just about the Clone Wars It's a deeper study into how the Republic fell we get a better understanding of why Anakin would become disenfranchised with the Jedi everything the prequel movies tried to convey about the Jedi is expanded upon further in the Clone Wars the Jedi became corrupt arrogant and ultimately were largely responsible for their own downfall one of the most disliked arcs of the Clone Wars is the Martez sisters Arc and yeah it's not great what is important about those episodes is Ahsoka learning how the Ordinary People view the Jedi they once thought the Jedi were the Guardians Of Peace but many now see how the Jedi are no longer that and plenty more even blame them for the Clone Wars the Clone Wars as a show is a deconstruction of the Jedi and their faults so what makes Rebels its spiritual successor is that it's a reconstruction of the Jedi Kanan was a Padawan when the Jedi Order fell he doesn't know what it really means to be a Jedi and since Order 66 all he has done is focus on Surviving yeah he and the ghost crew would sporadically attack the Empire but he never committed himself to something larger this is something we see in season 2 when he is reluctant to join the Rebellion when you and I started together it was Rob from the Empire give to the needy a noble cause now we're getting drawn into some kind of military thing Ezra's entrance into the ghost crew is a physical representation of kanan's insecurities Kanan ends the second episode with a promise that he will train Ezra to become a Jedi only a few episodes later Kanan is struggling with this more than he ever thought he would how could Kanan train someone else to be a Jedi he never completed his own training so when the ghost crew hears a message that Jedi Master luminara is alive Kanan is hopeful because she can be the one to properly train Ezra but Kanan doesn't realize that this is not what Ezra wants when we meet Ezra he is an orphan he has refused to make any real attachments with anyone why is he like this well his parents were taken away from him when he was young the pain of loving someone so much and then losing them can destroy a person and that pain has never left Ezra so when he meets up with the ghost crew he's reluctant to open himself up again what happens if they're taken away from him too or even worse what happens if they leave him Ezra's biggest fear in season 1 is that he will be tossed aside and forgotten just like he was last time so in episode 5 when Kaden is excited at the thought of having luminara train Ezra well this hurts Ezra because once again he is just being tossed aside by Kanan but luminara is revealed to be dead and it was all a trap to lure the remaining Jedi out of hiding Kanan and Ezra narrowly escaped the grand Inquisitor and when they return to lothal Kanan sees his mistake he promises Ezra that he will train him in that it won't be easy and he might fail as well but he's going to do it Kanan and Ezra both open up about their insecurities kanan's insecurity is that he can't train someone and ezraz is that he will be abandoned already enough episode 5 there is a strong difference between the way Ezra and Kanan interact and the way the Jedi of old would interact fear was taught to be avoided at all costs and even though compassion was embraced by the Jedi attachment was not Kanan and Ezra by expressing their insecurities form an attachment stronger than any two Jedi should but since Kanan doesn't know what it properly means to be a Jedi he decides to go down this path anyway as we enter the middle portion of the season the trust between the two continues to grow Ezra embarks on his own mission to enlist as an imperial Cadet for a few weeks this stresses Kanan out because his biggest fear is not that he can't train Ezra but that he will fail him altogether if Ezra gets hurt or even dies it is kanan's Fault many get frustrated with season 1 of Star Wars Rebels saying that outside of a few episodes most of them were just Filler episodes where the crew embarked on a mission got some Intel or equipment and then moved on while this is certainly the case for some episodes it isn't the case for a lot of them there's a two episode Arc halfway through the season where Ezra meets an old family friend named Zebo Ezra learns that Zebo betrayed his parents and this infuriates Ezra at first but with the help of Kanan Ezra learns an important trait learning to forgive these episodes aren't filler because Ezra learns not how to use the force or properly wield a lightsaber but because he learns what it means to be a guardian of peace and Justice the Clone Wars showed us all the wrong ways to be a Jedi therefore four Rebels is going to show us all the right ways to be a Jedi and being a Jedi is more than just lifting rocks Ezra and Kanan inevitably go to this Jedi Temple on lothal it's pitched as a test for Ezra but it's also a test for Kanan throughout the first season Kanan is giving in to his fear when the grand Inquisitor arrives he further feeds kanan's insecurities he repeatedly bests Kanan in duels and tells Kanan that he was a coward for running away from his master but what Kanan does intentionally or not is help raise Ezra as a good person before training him to become a Jedi this leads to the ghost crew's Most Daring Mission yet to send a broadcast out across the Galaxy that they need to stand up to the Empire to fight for Freedom Ezra is able to get the broadcast out to the Galaxy but only because Kanan sacrificed himself to give Ezra the time to send that message what Keenan does here is what I believe to be the most noble of sacrifices it's one thing to sacrifice yourself for a sure thing it's something entirely different to sacrifice yourself for something unknown it's so brilliant about the ending of Rogue one is not that the main crew sacrificed themselves to destroy the Death Star they sacrificed their lives at the chance of destroying the Death Star when that wave hits Jin and Cassian neither know if their sacrifice will be worth it but they gladly take that risk anyway Kanan may not die here but he sacrificed himself in the hope that Ezra's broadcast would mean something and that is one of the more Jedi things anyone has done but maybe even more importantly he sets an example for Ezra he has given Ezra a home and a family he has shown Ezra what it means to not necessarily be a good Jedi but be a good person this is what inspired Ezra to not only send this broadcast out in the first place but also to sacrifice himself to save Kanan Ezra is the one who leads the mission to rescue Kanan and ultimately he succeeds but first they must fight the grand Inquisitor one last time during The Final Duel Kanan is finally able to let go of his fear after a fake out death from Ezra Kanan renouncing his fears finally allowed him to best the grand Inquisitor for the first time Keenan was able to solely try just in the force and not let the wrong emotions Cloud him the Jedi of the prequels may have been right about not letting fear control you but where they were wrong is that love and compassion is a strength not a weakness it is kanan's love and compassion for Ezra that allows him to surrender his fears and beat the grand Inquisitor this is something that Kanan only believes more strongly later on the final moments of the grand Inquisitor is a promise that there are worse things to fear than death there are some things far more frightening in the final shot of the season shows us what that thing is [Music] throughout season 1 Ezra doesn't progress much along his Jedi training sure he gets his lightsaber and sure he does become stronger with the force but where he truly progresses is with his heart through kanan's example he is already on the path to becoming a better Jedi than most before him Kanan took his first step with letting go of his fear but he has a long way to go too season one does excel at developing Kanan and Ezra but what about the other characters Zeb Sabine Hera and Chopper may not have the depth that Ezra and Kanan have by the end of season 1 but that doesn't mean they don't have personality each member of the ghost crew has a distinct personality and role on the team Sabine is The Loner girl who expresses her emotions through ART Zeb is the brute who forms a brotherly banter with Ezra Hera is the mother of the group who is tough but also nurturing and Chopper is the psychopathic Droid who thrives on experiencing the pain of others there are a handful of moments in the season that do give us a hint at the backstories for these characters in episode 3 we learned that Zeb species the lasates are in danger the Empire attacked them and used these special weapons against them to imprison and kill them just like that we understand why Zeb is involved with this fight against the empire with Sabine we know that she was once a part of the Imperial Academy but eventually being left in the dark led to her leaving the academy Hera does have some connections to The Wider Rebellion but nothing too serious so some may look at the lack of development with these characters as a bad thing but I don't think that's fair yet when this season was created it was created with the knowledge that a second season was coming therefore more time to develop the characters season 1 is largely focused on Kanan and Ezra and since they are the heart and soul of the series I think it's only fair that they get developed first before the supporting characters with that all out of the way where this series excels is with its characters Where It suffers is from the limitations of being on Disney XD before Disney plus there was Disney XD and while the Clone Wars had Mass beheadings and other kinds of violence on Cartoon Network you weren't going to get any of that on Disney XD but more violent doesn't always mean better Star Wars Rebels just happens to go too far in the opposite direction by making the show too Kitty in order to appeal to the younger audience the writers made the Empire the brunt of a lot of jokes Often by painting them with complete incompetence the series is titled Rebels because they are rebelling against the empire sure we see some of the horrors the Empire commits but all series long and especially this season the writers refuse to allow the Empire to pose any real threat to our band of characters episode after episode our characters invade Imperial bases and escape with not even a scratch one of the more disliked episodes of season 1 is episode 4 fight or flight this episode involved Ezra and Zeb going on a grocery run and then completely embarrassing the Empire so they could steal a piece of fruit wait you did all this for fruit no no okay maybe a little other instances make it seem like the Empire doesn't even take itself seriously in the second episode a stormtrooper makes a joke to kallus and kallus responds by blatantly killing one of his own men sure Imperials have killed their own men before but in those cases it was done to make us fear the villain here this was a cheap trick to make the audience laugh and while it may have made some of the kids laugh it definitely took me out of the moment another tactic Star Wars Rebels loves to employ is dehumanizing people who are about to die I don't think we ever actually get to see behind the mask of a stormtrooper and even the Imperial officers who don't hide their faces almost always hide their eyes by hiding their eyes they are seen as less human to the viewers and thus they are easier to kill off the series even does this with some of the rebels later on Star Wars the Clone Wars I feel often suffered from not painting the separatists in a serious light and I feel felony made the same mistake with the empire in Rebels lastly similar to the force awakens the series is reliance on connecting to the original trilogy can sometimes be a hindrance sure Rebels takes place during that era of the original trilogy so it's only fair that connections are made but sometimes the series goes too far out of its way to make a connection in episode 3 our main characters run into R2D2 and C-3PO an entire episode later in the season is developed to the crew going on a mission with Lando of all people and of course Grandma Tarkin plays a larger role in the season sure you're allowed to make connections to The Wider Star Wars universe but given the context of how lucasfilm was in 2014 I get the vibe that in order to keep some audience members invested the writers threw in connections to the Beloved original trilogy we even had to have Kanan quote Yoda's do or do not line from The Empire Strikes Back do or do not there is no try what does that even mean how can I do something if I don't try to do it as the series progresses moments like these do become fewer and fewer but they are evidently noticeable in season one however where season 1 appears to employ cheap fan service at times it's season 2 where the series really starts to get its footing but before I move on I want to thank the sponsor of today's video extra wallets extra was kind enough to send me two of their wallets and I love how slim and clean they look one of the biggest issues I've had with my current wallet which is this bulky thing is that sometimes it takes me forever to get my cards out but with extra all I have to do is click on the panel at the bottom and boom all your cards are out and ready to use a concern I had when I was first researching this wallet is if all the cards could easily fall out but it doesn't matter how hard you shake this thing your cards are not falling out another aspect of extra wallets that are so awesome is all the features it comes with while being so slim if you one day can't find your walleye and you're concerned that someone stole your credit cards or your driver's license well you can get a Tracker that you can hook up right to your phone this way you will never lose your wallet again extra wallets are also RFID protected which protects you from data theft and wireless skimming if you're in the need for an awesome wallet I'm offering a 25 discount using Code Goldman or you can just go to shop.exter.com Goldman Link in the description so come get your new wallet and thank you so much to extra for sponsoring this video foreign with Rebels did something similar to that of the Mandalorian felony clearly always has Ambitions to tie his story with the wider Star Wars Galaxy he did it with the Clone Wars he did it with Rebels and he did it with the mandovers what he does however is devote his entire first season to developing the characters on a small scale season 1 of rebels doesn't feature many of the prominent players we come to know in season two and on sure we get a few cameos like Lando but Lando isn't a key part of the series going forward season one also mostly takes place on lothal physically limiting us from the rest of the Galaxy once the audience has a good understanding of our characters and their Journeys that is when filoni decides to expand the Universe season 2 opens the show's Horizons drastically we are introduced to a handful of veterans returning from the Clone Wars we journey to many new locations some not unfamiliar to hardcore fans but even more so than that the show's visuals improved as well just like the Clone Wars a rough first season visually allowed the animators to improve significantly in the next season not only does the animation feel far smoother but the show is also a lot more visually ambitious the team behind Rebels implements a plethora of new visual tricks to convey its Story one of my favorites is during the Trek to lirasan where the colors are just bursting all over the screen because the animators were able to accomplish things never thought possible before they can take us to locations never thought possible before when discussing season 1 I mentioned how the season mostly focused on Kanan and Ezra while giving us only hints of a backstory for the rest of the crew season 2 still mostly focuses on Ezra and Kanan but with the size of the Season increasing from 15 episodes to 22 Episodes a handful of them are now devoted to fleshing out the rest of the ghost crew paragot little development in season one but here she gets two episodes where she is front and center episode 7 wings of the master and episode 16 Homecoming in the first of these two Hera is on a mission to get a new ship for the rebel Fleet she arrives on this Backwater planet and gets to Pilot a b-wing to prove herself to the mon calamari she describes what flying means to her to that ability to help others in need but it's all rooted in something I can't explain a need to be up there although brief this insight into Hera's past gives us an understanding of why she would leave lothal to help the wider Galaxy which ties into the second episode where we meet Champs indula Hera's father to no one's surprise felony can't help himself from referencing the Clone Wars but seeing how the Empire's tyranny has divided Hera and her father only gives us another reason why they both hate the Empire what I love about this episode is that Hera helps her father go on his own arc at first his priorities are only to ryloth wanting to destroy this carrier just to send a message to his people but Hera over the years has learned the importance of sacrificing for the greater good something she helps her father understand he lets the rebels keep the carrier while still sending a message of Hope to ryloth of course Hera is no Jedi but this idea of being selfless is inherently Jedi which is important to Ezra's development now some similar to Hera Sabine only got crumbs of development in season one in season 2 Sabine only gets further development but her story may be more than anyone else's is tied into another important theme of the season and that's confronting the past in the eighth episode of the Season titled blood sisters Sabine runs into one of her former Bounty Hunter friends her past was only briefly mentioned in season one but here we learned that Sabine was once selfish like chamson Doula was but through the help of the ghost crew she too learned the importance of fighting for a larger cause a lesson she passes on to her old friend ketsu who proceeds to fight for the Rebels on occasion throughout the rest of the series Hera's past caught up to her when she had to confront her father for the first time in years and with Sabine it will be confronting other mandalorians in the 13th episode of the season the protector of Concord Dawn the crew runs into another group of mandalorians in this episode Sabine struggles with her personal Vendetta to hurt fenrau and Hera's wishes of helping the wider Rebellion sabine's majority shines through when she not only heeds Heroes and Kanan wishes but does it in her own way there's a lot more backstory for Sabine that will be unraveled but just like season 2 as a whole these few episodes are only the first steps into a wider Universe now while Sabine and Hera do have some pretty good episodes in season two it's zeb's episodes that really shine through in the 14th episode of the Season Legacy of lassan Zeb is reunited with other lasades they praise Zeb as this hero to the lasad people something that frustrates him despite being this large immature brute we've come to know we learned that Zeb is someone who takes his honor very seriously in his failure with the lasat people is something that haunts him Ezra having gone through his own struggles of losing people he loves he helps Zeb realize that he has a second chance to do things right Zeb helps his people navigate to this prophesized lira-san and after an impressive visual display they've reached the mystical World Zeb has not only helped these innocent lassats but after receiving knowledge that his species is thriving on this new world a new sense of hope is instilled in him something that carries over greatly into one of maybe the best episodes of the season the honorable ones trapped in the caves underneath a frozen tundra Zeb and agent kallus must work together to escape kallus up to this point has just been the one-dimensional face of the Empire over and over and over again kallus is there trying to stop our Rebels only to fail every time in season 1 we learned that kallus was there when the Empire attacked the lasat people something that Zeb takes very personally however we get a perspective on what really happened just like how the Empire hurt zeb's people it was the lasat who also hurt callous's people Zeb may not have truly forgiven kallus yet but a temporary truce now exists [Music] the episode ends with kallus observing the family Zeb has grown to love while he sits alone pondering what he wants out of his own life so Zeb Sabine and Hera all got episodes further developing them and their backstories but it doesn't stop there even Chopper gets an episode episode 19 of the season is titled the Forgotten Droid and it is maybe the most underrated episode of the entire series Chopper meets a new friend ap5 who is also objectively the best Droid in Star Wars why well he's pretty much Squidward but a robot my programming is superior to yours yes it is yes it is this episode portrays the miserable life of ab5 he's bullied by Imperial officers and reflects on his surface during the Clone Wars after he befriends Chomper he decides to help the Rebellion by giving them the new coordinates for a safe base he gets shot however and almost dies while thanking Chopper just for being his friend I will forget you my my friends dude I almost cried watching this episode the depth this Droid got in one episode must be applauded ap5 does end up getting revived and his hilarious banter with chopper only continues Star Wars Rebels did a great job with expanding its existing Supporting Cast in season 2. however it's still Kanan and Ezra that are the heart of the series season 1 was a lesson in confronting fear season 2 however is a reminder that fear is not something that you overcome once it's an ongoing battle that you must continue to fight later in the season Yoda spells this out to Ezra as the theme of the season the challenge Life along it is not to bend fear into anger so how does season 2 explore the theme of this battle against fear well with fear itself [Music] oh Darth Vader arrives on the scene and the dichotomy between him and the grand Inquisitor is staggering Darth Vader is not just another Dark Side user but he is a total force to be reckoned with felony doesn't waste any time giving the audience hope that Kanan or Ezra can stand up to Vader they flee with all with the promise that Vader is on their tail Vader and the two new inquisitors serve as a reminder that fear is not something you can conquer it will forever be a struggle before Kanan meets the two new inquisitors he must confront an even bigger fear from his past the Clones actually my name is Rex Captain 501st clone Battalion in just the third episode of the Season we are introduced to Captain Rex a decorated and Fan Favorite hero from the Clone Wars as we saw in the bad batch the Clones were the ones to betray Kanan and murder his master it won't be easy for Kanan to trust Rex but through Rex's encounters with Ezra Kanan considers the possibility that maybe he can grow to trust Rex in a battle against three atats Rex and Kane show everyone how powerful a clone and Jedi Duo is using both their unique skills to overcome insurmountable odds later in the season the bickering between Kanan and Rex only continues but after Rex sacrifices himself to save Kanan Kanan Returns the favor by risking his life to save Rex trust has now been formed between the two and this is just the first example of Kanan confronting his new fears while Kanan struggles with that Ezra must struggle with the truth about his parents after a vision he had of his parents Ezra and Kanan returned to lothal to discover more clues about the truth Ezra runs into an old family friend optimistic he will finally be able to see his parents again but Ezra's biggest fear has been realized his parents are dead and he will never see them again after Ezra's speech in season 1 Mr and Mrs Bridger LED an uprising in an imperial prison While others like Ryder were able to escape Mr and Mrs Bridger were not so lucky how does this make Ezra feel sure his parents were inspired by Ezra's speech but without that speech Maybe his parents would still be alive as returns this anger into a passionate hatred for the Empire desperate to find a solution to destroying the Sith in season one we saw Ezra grow into this trusting and loving person and while those are all great qualities to have being too trusting can leave yourself vulnerable to betrayal Ezra takes on new Mentor figures throughout the season some positive and some negative one of the more popular ones from the season comes from the Clone Wars veteran Hondo onaka being the pirate that Hondo is Ezra must be careful in where he can place his trust before Ezra Falls victim to the next person willing to take advantage of him Ezra Kanan and Ahsoka must travel back to lethal to get more answers from the Jedi Temple Kanan and Ezra are confronted with more of their fears from their past as we've seen throughout a vast array of Star Wars stories whenever someone enters a force cave they are confronted with their fears Luke was confronted with Vader Rey was confronted with her being no one and Kanan was confronted with the idea of Ezra turning to the dark side the temple guards tell Kanan he cannot protect Ezra forever but a more confident Canaan responds by saying he can only do the best he can you're right I can't protect Ezra forever not even from himself all I can do is what I've done training the best I could this shows maturity in Kanan from his counterpart in season one he passes the test and is awarded the rank of Jedi Knight Ahsoka has a limited role throughout the season just like plenty of others in the season she is a familiar face from the Clone Wars back in 2016 the last we had seen of Ahsoka was her walking away from the Jedi Order now almost two decades later in the chronology Ahsoka has discovered the truth about the fate of her master she spends All Season trying to get more answers about what happened and when she enters the Jedi Temple on lothal her biggest fears are only confirmed do you know what I've become while Kanan and Ahsoka are confronted with their fears Ezra gets to happily talk to Yoda Ezra promises Yoda that he will continue to fight the Sith and the Empire this leaves Yoda no choice but to send him to malachor there's often been much discussion about why Yoda chose to send Ezra and Company to malachor especially considering the Fate that awaits them the Jedi during the Clone Wars decided to fight in a war what did this lead to the eradication of their order and the rise of a tyrannical Empire Yoda knows the dangers of what happens when people choose to fight pain and suffering after the death of his parents Ezra is passionate to fight those he hates Yoda didn't send Ezra to malachor in order to Aid him in their fight against the inquisitors and the Sith but rather to warn him by showing him where the path of aggression leads what they encounter is the remnants of a battlefield the Jedi and Sith once fought each other here and who won the battle as Kanan says it looks like no one won this was the first hint of the Fate that awaits Ezra and Kanan the inquisitors show up but more importantly Ezra runs into a shadow of the past Maul Star Wars the Clone Wars expanded Maul more than anyone could have ever thought possible Maul originally was just a face of the Sith in The Phantom Menace what flony did in the Clone Wars was not just resurrect him but tie his story to the Greek mythological figure of Sisyphus Sisyphus story leads him to the punishment of eternally rolling a boulder up a mountain only for him to never reach the top what awaits Maul at the top of his mountain is the destruction of the Sith time and time again decade after decade Maul will use his rage and anger to try and try again to destroy the Sith only for him to fail every time forever doomed to repeat his mistakes he focuses his efforts on manipulating Ezra promising him knowledge but really tricking him into luring Invader and activating a weapon Ezra's naivety not only leads him to activating the weapon but to kanan's blindness [Music] how will this affect Kanan going forward season 3 explores that but before we get there we get the Twilight of The Apprentice [Music] fate reunites Ahsoka and Vader all those years ago Ahsoka left Anakin to forge her own path burden with a thought that Anakin's fall was her fault she vows not to leave Anakin again this time with hope that he can be saved but even someone as close to Anakin as Ahsoka was couldn't help bring him back the two fight as the temple collapses season 2 ends with tragedy Kanan is blinded Soka is presumed dead and Ezra grows ever closer to the dark side the Battle of malachor is over but the battle against fear will continue before I continue on with the rest of this video only 8.6 percent of viewers are subscribed to this channel so if you're enjoying this video please consider subscribing for more content like this thank you [Music] season three begins with notable changes Ezra not only has grown and cut his hair but he is significantly stronger with the force the last we saw Ezra he was defeated his master got hurt and his other Mentor might be dead all because he trusted Maul in order to make sure his friends never get hurt again he resorts to the dark side like Anakin he craves the power to save the ones he loves the passion that Ezra had in season 2 to find the secrets of destroying the Sith Still Remains and that passion only further fuels the dark side after a successful Mission Ezra is promoted and put in charge of the next mission thinking he is Unstoppable he makes careless mistakes thinking he can do everything because he is all-powerful however the dark side is only an illusion and Ezra is left stranded on a collapsing station helpless to stop it the time frame between the end of season 2 and the beginning of season 3 is not specifically stated but Ezra is not the only one who has changed Kanan now blinded and defeated feels lost how can he continue to be the master to Ezra when he can't even see Kanan is filled with self-doubt until he stumbles across the bendu Dave filoni has never been shy with expanding the Mythos of the force as Ahsoka said in season 2 just when you think you understand the force you find out how little you actually know throughout his 10-year running the Clone Wars Dave filoni introduced plenty of new Concepts to the force the introduction of the father son and daughter along with Yoda meeting the wills are just a few examples here in Rebels the bendu is neither Jedi nor Sith neither light nor dark he is the one in the middle by abstaining from both the light and dark sides he's able to gain a wider knowledge of the force and he possesses the knowledge to help Kanan but the bendu is able to do for Kanan is help him see not with his eyes but with the force in season 1 Kanan overcame his fear to defeat the grand Inquisitor and now he must do it again fear grief anger that's how they see me that's how I see myself Kanan realizes the consequences his fear has had on others especially Ezra because he has been so distant since the events on malachor Ezra has lost his guidance and is resorted to the dark side a path that led him on the brink of death both a newfound purpose and his vision restored only through the force Kanan is there for Ezra reaching out his hand both physically and metaphorically in order to truly understand the dangers of the dark side Ezra had to suffer the consequences of his actions and those consequences were the face of death Kanan vows not to be absent again and Ezra promises to renounce the lessons of the Sith holocron and continue back down the path of the Jedi I remember going into season 3 Ezra's struggle with the dark side was teased heavily while I was disappointed that the struggle only lasted for the first two episodes of the Season it was done adequately enough to leave me satisfied just as season 2 had done season 3 only continues to expand Ezra's worldview he meets a handful of new people from all corners of the Galaxy some relics of the past asked some present in the moment but none are more notable than saw Guerrera another veteran of the Clone Wars Saul has represented how all forms of rebellion are not equal as Hera noted just because someone shares a common enemy that doesn't mean they share the same values and goals where the ghost crew and the rebels we know and love believe in empathy and compassion Saul only believes in results willing to risk the extinction of a species just to get Clues to the Empire's plans what Saul represents is a warning to Ezra that if you let your passion and anger consume you too much then you can end up becoming the very thing you want to destroy saw implements the same tactics that the Empire does Ezra realizes this and makes sure he doesn't make that mistake either but just because there are warnings all around him and he acknowledges his failures in the second episode of the Season that doesn't mean the Temptation isn't still there and that temptation is symbolized through Maul Ezra and Maul both seek the same thing the destruction of the Sith and as long as Maul is still around Ezra's Quest defines said knowledge remains just as saw was one reminder of what happens when you become too extreme Maul is another reminder of what happens when you devote your life to the destruction of someone else as I mentioned in my analysis of the second season Maul is forever doomed to roll that boulder up the mountain and here he continues his quest to destroy the Sith he and Ezra merge the holocrons to gain the answers they seek at around the halfway point of the Season Ezra and Ma learned that the answers they both seek lie on a desert planet with twin Sons despite the warnings of both his friends and his master Ezra makes the Trek to finally get the answers he needs he has an exact location of where Obi-Wan Kenobi is however when he gets there he finds nothing stranded in the desert Ezra's Quest For Destruction has only brought him nothing but pain and suffering until an old friend arrives one criticism I've often heard about Star Wars Rebels was that Ezra spends so much time trying to get the answers to defeating the Sith only for that story to go nowhere he's just told to stop and he listens I think the reason this narrative decision was so wise is because star Star Wars Rebels is not about that as Star Wars has taught us countless times everyone has their own destiny and Ezra's Destiny is not to destroy the Sith and no matter what he does and no matter how passionate he is about that he's never going to be the one to destroy the Sith Ezra's Destiny lies elsewhere and who better to teach him that lesson than Obi-Wan Kenobi Obi-Wan was once a decorated general of the Republic however Order 66 and the rise of the empire has forced him into hiding Obi-Wan is likely aware of the ongoing Rebellion against the empire and just like Kanan and Ezra Obi-Wan would surely be a great help to the Rebellion but Obi-Wan now older and wiser than he was 20 years ago knows his Destiny doesn't lie with the Rebellion it lies with this Farm Boy longing for something more but until that day arrives fate leads Obi-Wan encountering one of his biggest foes again Maul Obi-Wan doesn't show it here the mall is likely the source of so much of Obi-Wan's pain Maul was the one who killed not only his master but also the only woman he ever loved but this wiser Obi-Wan doesn't let his anger Cloud his judgment instead he uses his thoughts of his Fallen Master to save him as many have pointed out when Maul attacks Obi-Wan he uses the same moves he used against Qui-Gon way back when Obi-Wan thinking of his old Master anticipates this and properly counters ending the fight in only a few seconds oh I know how to beat you tries the same move that he did they used to kill Qui-Gon and that's what kills them all Obi-Wan once held Qui-Gon and Satine in his arms just before their deaths and because he is the empathetic man he now is he does the same for Maul the man who killed the two others I just mentioned also all those years ago fate led to Maul fighting Obi-Wan once before only for him to lose and fall down a dark Cavern but since he keeps on repeating his same mistakes Fate has led him to fighting Obi-Wan again for this time he will meet his permanent end this moment here is one of the best Obi-Wan and Mall moments in the franchise because it shows us how far this broken man in Obi-Wan has come and it shows the dangers of where Maul's path leads going back to our ghost crew the older characters such as Hera and Kanan take a narrative back seat so the younger characters like Ezra and Sabine can continue to develop we've spoken about how Ezra has been challenged this season but what about Sabine for more than the first two seasons combined Sabine really gets to shine through this season after journeying to with Ezra halfway through the season Sabine comes in contact with the darksaber in the years since the conclusion of rebels we have seen the story of the darksaber come to an end many remember the long journey it has taken but some forget its brief chapter with Sabine Keenan tries to help Sabine wield the darksaber but just as he once did with Ezra he struggles with Sabine too this girl has been described as a loner all series she sticks to herself makes her own art and rarely if ever opens up to anyone if Sabine is going to be successful with the darksaber she needs to open up in one of the best monologues of the series Sabine finally opens up about her fears and her anger my family did stand with me they chose the empire they left me all those years of build up and rage all come bursting Out and because she has now come clean about her fears she is ready to confront her family once again the dark saber we learned that her family sees her as a traitor she had built weapons that the Empire had used against mandalorians that guilt has kept her away from her family for so long but now that she's opened up she wants to work with her family again unaware of the woman Sabine has become in the past few years her mother initially betrays her trust leading Mandalorian turned Imperial gar Saxon to her doorstep Sabine won't leave her family this time however with the help of Ezra's lightsaber and kanan's training she fights gar Saxon and wins with Clan wren's betrayal of the Empire out there they're going to need all the help they can get Sabine decides to stay behind and help her family in this Mandalorian Civil War season 4 will do more with sabine's journey but I love how season 3 really took the time to give Sabine this Arc what season 3 has done far better than season two is take advantage of its 22 episode season by having multi-episode arcs and while this Mandalorian Arc was brief we learned so much about Sabine Kanan and the mandalorians sabine's absence from the Rebellion may seem like a great loss but for three seasons now the Rebellion has grown into a formidable Force they have gained allies weapons vehicles and the confidence to plan an attack on lothal but maybe their most unlikely Ally comes from their oldest foe agent kallus Star Wars is no stranger to Redemption arcs people argue Vader's Redemption Arc is one of the best in cinema and kylo Ren's Redemption follows in a similar path to Vaders countless Redemption however is much different than Vader's or kylo's Vader and kylo redeemed themselves through sacrifice Vader did so by Saving his son and kylo did so by giving his life to Rey now as powerful as these redemptions may be one could argue that Redemption through death and sacrifice is a bit of a cop-out Vader and kylo committed evil acts some that too many are unforgivable is it fair that these characters get to give their lives and have everything forgiven I'm not saying it is or isn't fair but it's an interesting discussion nonetheless I think it's undeniable though that the harder form of redemption is to atone for your mistakes kallus was introduced as the stand Imperial officer we see him as a bad guy nothing too special but Dave filoni wisely did is give us a reason to hate him personally countless in the third episode taunted Zeb with the near extinction of the lasad people because of this it is easy for us to root against kallus and for all of the first season and most of the second season we see him the exact same way evil Imperial clumsy officer loses a lot we're happy but as I mentioned with season 2 The Encounter between Zeb and kallus on the snowy Moon fundamentally changed him he realizes the Empire isn't going to make him happy so he decides to defect and join the Rebels for about the first half of season 3 we are introduced to a new fulcrum and it is revealed later on that fulcrum is kallus now this isn't played as some kind of big reveal it was a mystery that was kinda predictable which is fine just because something is predictable that doesn't mean it is bad Ezra and Kanan toy with him a little bit because they don't entirely trust him which makes perfect sense throughout the season kallus continues to help them until he is caught by thrawn kallus manages to escape ape in a rather silly way but officially joins the rebels nonetheless kallus is by no means one of the most important characters in the series but I love how he had to earn his Redemption he couldn't just be forgiven with one act like Vader and kylo were I'll touch on it a bit later but the resolution to this Redemption Arc was beautiful to wrap up this discussion of season 3 we need to discuss the most underrated battle in the Star Wars franchise the Battle of adalon what makes this battle so great well first we need to look at its most important player thrawn even though thrawn made his debut to the Star Wars canon in late 2016. thrawn has actually been around before even the prequels the heir to the Empire Trilogy debuted back in 1991 and gave us the introduction to Grand Admiral thrawn thrawn is a tactical genius able to analyze strategy and patterns better than almost anybody but more importantly he studies art in order to defeat your enemies you must know them and thrawn is the embodiment of that philosophy all season thrawn has seemingly held back wait waiting for the perfect time to strike the rebels and after kallus Falls for his trap the battle begins like I've spoken about dozens of times on this channel a great battle should have its own narrative beats within it if we watch a battle that's just a Mindless action for 15 minutes then it's not a battle that's going to engage your audience you want narrative beats that are sprinkled throughout that each have their own moments of Victory and defeat those contrasting emotions is what keeps a viewer on the edge of their seat first we have the initial Escape which is repelled by the interdictor cruiser this isn't going to be an easy escape the rebels are trapped then we have the ongoing space battle which results in the rebels going nowhere after a mistake from Admiral Constantine Commander Sato sacrifices himself and Ezra is able to flee the battle the heroes get their first minor Victory the rebels Retreat to the base and withstand the orbital bombardment then the Empire sends down its walkers for a ground attack as all hope seems lost Ezra and the mandalorians arrive to take out the last interdictor Cruiser while this happens Rebels get captured only to be free by the bendu then they make their final Escape where the rebels survive but barely each one of these beats I mentioned serves as its own mini story it has a beginning middle and end each culminating with something good or bad for Our Heroes all the great battles in cinema history follow a similar formula one key aspect of this battle that contradicts a major criticism of the series that I've had is that the rebels always win all series every time there's a battle the Rebels win with minor casualties here during this battle the rebels get their asses handed to them some characters we've grown to care about die countless Cruisers are destroyed and even though some of them survive this battle was a major setback for the rebels I love the moment that Commander Santos sacrificed himself in the carrier just to destroy one interdictor Cruiser to give one ship an opening sacrifices had to be made if the rebels were going to survive this one another aspect of this battle that I really appreciated was that there was a clear strategy going in you don't often see tactical strategy in Star Wars battles it's usually just we need to blow up this thing and let's fight until we do so here thrawn talks about fortifying the center anticipating sato's counter-attack and so on as a geek who loves watching those YouTube videos on the strategy behind the battles in my favorite movies and shows seeing that kind of play out on screen was phenomenal the last point I want to bring up is how it handled thrawn's defeat if you would even call it a defeat thrawn was pinned as a tactical genius as I said earlier now having him lose his first battle we see in the series isn't going to be so great for the character's reputation especially going into season 4. so what the writers wisely do is have thrawn lose the battle because of two things entirely out of his control the first was Constantine blatantly disobeying thrawn's orders in fact by having this moment result in the Rebels first Escape only further amplifies thrawn's genius viewers can definitively say if everyone listened to thrawn the Empire would have won but even after that the other reason thrawn lost the battle was because of the attack from the bendu there is no way thrawn could have predicted A Magical Force being residing on the planet so when we look at what happened in the Battle two instances of pure luck had to go the rebels way in order for them to not really win this battle just survive so even though thrawn may have lost the battle his reputation as a tactical genius was only enhanced and those are the reasons why the Battle of adalon is a fantastic battle it's one of the most underrated battles in Star Wars and why it's a great conclusion to season three [Music] season 4 begins not with the continuation of Ezra and kanan's story but with the conclusion of sabine's story even though a lot of it did take place prior to the season Sabine has been through so much the Mandalorian culture means everything to her but for the longest time she felt rejected by the mandalorians bottling up this pain and anger has only held her back for so long after reuniting with her family and helping the rebels at the end of season 3 it's now the rebels turn to help her in season four Sabine has gone down to the character Arc of becoming the leader she knows she can be but now she must prove it to everyone else bocaton enters the picture as we have seen throughout both the Clone Wars and the Mandalorian Mandalore means just as much to her as it does anyone else Sabine is confronted firsthand with the mistakes of her past confronted by Bo Katan how will Sabine react to this will she run away for years on end like she did before nope she is not that woman anymore she takes account ability for her actions and instead of wallowing in self-pity she leads the attack to destroy the machine she created and give help to Mandalore if she can help her family retake their Homeworld then surely she can help her other family retake their Homeworld as well when the ghost crew returns to lothal the planet is in ruin ravaged by industrialization Ezra sees the physical change of the Fall as a consequence of his absence when he was younger the empire was there but the cities were still teeming with life and energy but now it's all gone he returns to one of his favorite bars Old Joe's only to find that locals don't even go there anymore just the Empire the last season of this series largely takes place on lothal acting as a bookend for the series by meeting Obi-Wan Ezra reminded himself that everyone has their own destiny and even though it may seem impossible Ezra's Destiny lies in freeing lothal just prior to returning to lothal Ezra and Sabine spend some time with saw Guerrera when we last that song it was a warning to Ezra about the dangers of extremism but this time Ezra takes a different lesson away from Saw sure it's always best to have help from others if you want to accomplish your goals but sometimes you need to take matters into your own hands and do it yourself Ezra cares about the wider Rebellion but because they are currently unable to Aid he must go there himself regardless of the odds while on lothal Kanan and Ezra run into the loath Wolves At first their purpose is confusing it is obvious that they have a strong connection to the force that has a deep connection to the force to the energy of this planet the Wolves repeat the word doom but what Kanan comes to realize is that they are not saying the word doom but the name Doom Keenan's birth name is not Kanan Jairus but Caleb doom doom is my name Caleb Doom is the name I was born with after Order 66 Kanan abandoned his name in order to better hide from the Empire the wolves are not calling for Kanan Jairus but for Caleb Doom from the beginning of the series Kanan has grown a lot he has faced fear after fear and has become a better man because of it a better father because of it after engaging the loath wolves on numerous occasions he finally realizes his Destiny Kanan once wondered why he was always brought back to LA fall he now knows his Destiny is tied to this planet but more importantly it is tied to Hera the Jedi for the longest time forbade love they saw love as a dangerous emotion that could lead to fear and jealousy this was the case with Anakin Anakin's love for Padme ultimately led to the fall of the Republic and the rise of the empire so were the Jedi right I would argue they weren't I proposed in the beginning of this video that Rebels was a spiritual successor to the Clone Wars not just because of Ezra and kanan's relationship but also because of Kanan and Hera's relationship after Hera is captured by the Empire Kanan will do whatever he can to make sure the love of his life doesn't perish the Jedi of old would have discouraged this but Kanan is not doing it in a controlling way like Anakin was he's doing it purely out of selflessness Kanan cuts his hair and shaves his beard because he knows his end is near I think at this point he knows he will die saving Hera and he is at terms with that for the first time in his life and the first time in this series especially Kanan has no fear when Kanan is confronted with what most people fear the most he is never more sure of himself coming full circle with where the series began the moments between Hera and Kanan are wonderfully done with her high on some Imperial drugs her banter with Kanan just shows how much the two have been through together and how much they both have grown before Ezra Sabine or Zeb showed up it was just Kanan and Hera on top of the Fuel Depot Kanan and Hera confessed their love for each other and then foreign foreign [Music] with the exception of Vader's death I think kanan's death is the most powerful death scene in Star Wars there's nothing more Jedi than sacrificing yourself for others and in one scene love and compassion were proven to be the most powerful and beautiful emotions in the final seconds of his life Kanan remains unconcerned with the fire behind him only concerned with the family in front of him kanan's death isn't filled with fear but with love when our heroes return back to the rebel base they are all broken Hera is utterly devastated blaming herself for not telling Kanan she loved him sooner Sabine and Hera turned to anger wanting to take out their rage onto the Empire that's currently celebrating ganon's death but most importantly Ezra is lost I love how this episode shows Our Heroes struggling with grief even during war not everyone is able to just move on so easily our heroes need the time to process the tragic death of a family member but they learned that it wasn't so tragic it was heroic Sabine and Zeb learned that through his death the Fuel Depot on lethal was destroyed the Thai Defender project was halted and even though the rebel attack failed kanan's sacrifice completed the mission I love how kanan's death is portrayed as this devastating tragedy at first only for the characters to truly learn the purpose behind it sure Kanan is dead but as Luke once said no one has ever really gone there are two ways to interpret this line one is the literal sense that Kanan is not gone the mythology energy of the force is complex but if there's one thing that the light side has taught us it's that death is not the end of your story The loath wolves are introduced in season of War Kanan realized the Deep connection the wolves have had with the force after his death he may not be able to turn himself into a ghost like Obi-Wan Yoda or Luke but his Spirit can be seen through the Wolves of course Ezra is confused by this only receiving some vague words and a stone from his Encounter With The Wolves this Stone leads him back to the Jedi Temple where he manages to enter the world Between Worlds since this concept was introduced so many fans online use its existence to create theories on how the Canon could be changed maybe certain parts of the Canon can be removed or maybe a new timeline without certain parts of the Canon can now exist what I find so laughable about this is that these theories completely contradict the message of the episode a world Between Worlds after Ezra saves Ahsoka he is given another chance to save Kanan but Ahsoka wisely warns Ezra about the importance of what Kanan did without that Sakura certain events don't unfold the rest of the ghost crew wouldn't be alive and Ezra wouldn't be there to help Ahsoka by Clinging On To The Past you're giving into a fear about a future you're going to end up living Ezra realizes this and learns to let go all those people who pray the world Between Worlds will retcon certain things have not learned to let go the episode ends with Ezra learning the other meaning of no one ever really being gone everything that Kanan represented resides within the ghost grew especially Ezra the path that Hera Zeb Sabine and Ezra choose to go down was paved by Kanan in order for someone to truly be gone their influence must be completely erased from existence and what better example of kanan's legacy persisting is there than the series finale the crew plans an attack they will go to the Imperial Dome draw in all their forces and launch it into the sky freeing lothal but things get complicated when thrawn returns being the Tactical genius that he is thrawn realizes Ezra's biggest mistake by drawing in all the Imperial forces they are safe from thrawn's threats of bombarding the city like Kanan Ezra knows what he must do his Destiny lies in freeing lothal and in order to do that he must go to thrawn alone I want to give major credit here to our tours Rebels video because he pointed out the beautiful symmetry of this Final Act Ezra began this series by himself stealing from the Empire stealing from others on the fall Ezra did everything alone and now entering thrawn Star Destroyer he is alone again Ezra in episode 1 only wanted one thing in the world to be with his parents again Palpatine presents him with that opportunity everything that Ezra has ever wanted is right in front of him so why does he reject Palpatine well because of everything we have seen in four seasons of this show Ezra has learned to let go and that his parents will never truly be gone but maybe more important than that are the people that Ezra has met along the way of course the ghost cruise Ezra's new family each one has built a special bond with Ezra but it's not just the ghost crew who was there liberating lothal Ryder Azadi was able to escape from an imperial prison because of the speech Ezra gave Captain Rex was recruited to the Rebellion largely because of Ezra's influence Johnny Kell was saved from the Imperial Academy because Ezra warned him Mark Matton was there because of Ezra's encounter with iron Squadron Hondo is there because of the bond he and Ezra have formed over the series ketsu onyo was there because Sabine changed her mind about fighting for a larger cause kallus is there because Zeb helped him realize how unhappy the empire was making him the ghost crew did not liberate lothal because they just decided to show up one day they got help from all the people they met along the way Ezra may be physically alone at this moment but he's not alone because everyone down in Imperial Dome is there because of him and that's the fundamental theme of Star Wars Lucas always emphasized how important it is to believe in the power of a community and in order to be on the light side you must be selfless and being selfless results in building a community of people you trust Ezra's final moments of the series follow the exact same footsteps as his master he sacrifices himself putting complete faith that the people he met the past four seasons will finish the mission and they did [Applause] the Star Wars Rebels ends with one of our ghost crew dead and the other missing for over a decade but the tone couldn't be any more uplifting Ezra and Kanan have redefined what it means to be a Jedi the Galaxy is now free kallus realized that he didn't extinct the lasante people in that they were all thriving and he's welcome as one of their own everything that Kanan and Ezra sacrificed was worth it but as Sabine says Ezra is still out there somewhere and it's time to bring him home thank you so Star Wars Rebels all these years later its impact has certainly been felt watching the Ahsoka series feels like it was written as a love letter to Rebels fans and despite the tough reception it got when it first debuted the series is now beloved by many and holds a special place in the Canon Sure Rebels is not a perfect show the ways a lot of things were handled still bothers me the limitations from Disney XD clearly did handicap the series from its fullest potential a handful of episodes especially in Seasons two and three really do feel like filler just to get the season to 22 Episodes but upon my most recent re-watch the reason none of this matters is because of the heart that clearly went into this show and many forget that Rebels was the first time flony got to properly conclude a series The Clone Wars remained unfinished back in 2018 and flony sure as hell was going to take his first finale as seriously as he could the attachments that I have to these characters truly means the world to me and that's why even six years later Star Wars Rebels remains as my favorite Star Wars show in the entire Canon what do you guys think about Star Wars Rebels all these years later let me know down below thank you everyone so much for watching another one of my videos don't forget tonight the Clone Squad and I will see you guys next time

Wafflegamr",funding for shaperless is provided by squarespace the sponsor of today's video from websites and online stores to marketing tools and analytics squarespace is the all-in-one platform to build a beautiful online presence and run your business happy may the 4th gamers today i'd like to talk about the most wholesome scene in all of star wars order 66. edit i just found out what order 66 actually is how do i delete my previous sentence for those who don't know order 66 is a moment in the star wars canon that strikes fear into the hearts of all star wars fans it's the moment where palpatine right after luring anakin to the dark side and getting his face all puffy via force lightning contacts all the clone troopers across the galaxy and initiates a top secret order that forces them all to kill the jedi within moments the vast majority of the jedi order is wiped out in one fell swoop all thanks to the sinister senate it's one of the most important moments in the entire star wars canon but i have to say as someone who's been a star wars fan my entire life it didn't really feel all that impactful when it was first shown in revenge of the sith here's the thing the main tragedy of revenge of the sith story is anakin's fall to the dark side and the fact that he would go to such dark places and betray his friends and family in the process within the context of revenge of the sith story as it's presented solely in the movie order 66 feels like more of a cleanup job for the writing a way to explain how the jedi order spread out across the galaxy was wiped out and why only obi-wan and yoda remain it's a good scene thanks in large part to john william's excellent score but on its own it doesn't really elicit much emotional reaction from me and i feel like that's blasphemous to say so let me explain further pretend for a second that it's 2005. revenge of the sith has just come out in theaters and you're watching it you see this guy piloting his starship oh no he got shot down i mean that's kind of sad but also who was that guy oh yeah he was in the background and the other prequels oh no it's the blue lady she she was also that person in the background in the other movies and now she's dead oh man that's rough buddy now the guy with the pointy head is dead man oh well i guess i i i i i don't really know these people it's 2005. there's no long ass show dedicated to fleshing out the individual members of the jedi council who die here so like i don't know it's sad this long-standing institution is getting destroyed and that people are dying but i don't really know them so it kind of loses some of its emotional impact sure the score is excellent and yoda's reaction to these deaths is kind of sad but it's not quite as emotionally affecting as anakin's turn to the dark side say what you will about the acting and the directing and whatnot i certainly have but ultimately it's sad that anakin is turning his back on obi-wan because we know these characters and we may have grown attached to them because they were the focus of the prequel trilogy these other nameless dialogue-less jedi are not and yes i know that they had established names at this point you don't have to tell me it's just the fact that they never mentioned their names in the entire trilogy you know what other characters in this scene we don't know at all the clones in fact it's actually kind of hilarious in hindsight how unimportant the clones are to the movies they appear in an attack of the clones they act as a plot device a mysteriously funded army that the jedi can use during the clone wars that can also eventually betray them in revenge of the sith where they're also used as a plot device that kills the jedi order and then becomes the empire's army for a bit i guess they were just evil the whole time because they execute order 66 without question and kill the jedi they served under for three years well that's great i mean i guess it's still kind of a betrayal but it's a betrayal that practically non-existent characters are performing on other practically non-existent characters with the exceptions of obi-wan and yoda who survive anyway so it's not a huge deal once again it's a good scene but more so for the music and how it advances the plot not really because of any investment in the characters the betrayal here just feels underdeveloped because the characters involved in it aren't developed in the slightest so how come when i watch this scene nowadays it actually makes me cry in recent years order 66 has had somewhat of a renaissance in star wars media not only has the original scene and revenge of the sith been enhanced with new context and information courtesy of the clone wars but we've also gotten to see order 66 from way more perspectives than we've ever had before and it's happened to a lot more characters we've grown emotionally attached to over the years and it's been presented using much more compelling storytelling and directing techniques it's gone from a mildly sad thing that just kind of happened as a backdrop to anakin's fault of the dark side and palpatine's rise to power to the single most heartbreaking event in the entire star wars canon but how did we get here how did this small 4-minute scene in revenge of the sith become the basis for some of the best star wars stories out there well before we can talk about the new iterations of order 66 we have to talk about the show that laid the groundwork for the power of this moment star the clone wars wars yeah patrick and i are doing a retrospective on the entire series so we were and still are going to cover all this stuff eventually but it's still worth analyzing a ton of this show's brilliance here one of the best aspects of clone wars is how it fleshes out the key players of the order 66 scene and turns them into actual characters i'll admit i don't think we ever saw speeder bike lady in the show and yes i know her name is stasali you don't have to tell me but the other jedi in this scene become actual characters kiarimundi and ayla sakura both get arcs in this show where we get to see what their personalities are like and get a little attached to them and yeah we knew kitty mundy was very adamant about stopping the droid attack on the wookiees but we never really knew much of this guy's actual personality getting to actually see him playfully join anakin and ahsoka's game over who killed the most droids is a cute detail that adds to his character and makes his death a little sadder meanwhile plo hits way different this guy is super fleshed out in clone wars probably because he's dave filoni's favorite he has a special connection with ahsoka as the one who found her and brought her to the temple and he appears in a ton of episodes it's actually really sad to see him die now especially since he's the one who said that famous line about how clones aren't expendable to him speaking of which the other key players in this scene are the clones and at this point i don't need to tell you that the clones are infinitely better fleshed out in clone wars than they are in the prequels they all have individual personalities and aspirations and they feel like actual characters rather than plot devices most importantly they form bonds with their jedi generals which makes it all the more heartbreaking when they break those bonds and shoot the jedi down this is especially effective with commander cody we've gotten to see supporting obi-wan over the course of multiple episodes it kind of stings that their relationship ends in heartbreak and attempted murder but at the same time making the clones into such well-rounded and likable individuals throughout the first five seasons of clone wars kinda makes their betrayal make even less sense if they're not mindless drone to obey every order without question then why would they turn on the jedi with zero hesitation i pondered this for a while as a kid but fortunately the answer finally came in the season 6 inhibitor chip arc it's so hard to believe that arguably the most important clone wars arc in terms of its implications for the larger star wars canon almost didn't air because this was right when disney took over and canceled the show thank god they got to finish these episodes for a release on netflix because this arc really changes everything i'm not going to get too into it because again patrick and i are going to get to this arc when we cover season 6. but basically this storyline kicks off when clone trooper tupp suddenly shoots one of his jedi generals the jedi and other clones are stunned by this even though we as an audience can easily surmise that this is an accidental early instance of order 66 and this is later explicitly confirmed within the arc tuff is taken back to kamino so the kaminoans can run tests on him and discover the cause of his sudden urge to kill the jedi and by discover i mean cover up since the cameron owens don't want the jedi or the clones to know that the inhibitor chips placed inside of each clone's brain are meant to take away their free will and force them to carry out order 66 when the time comes top's chip malfunctioned and caused him to execute the order too early but the kaminoans are trying to claim that a virus caused tup to go haywire however tupps buddy fives conducts his own investigation and discovers that the inhibitor chips are inside of every clone he manages to remove his chip and requests an audience with a supreme chancellor to tell him all about the cameron owens manipulation but uh oh it wasn't their manipulation they were just following orders from lord tyranus aka count dooku who was just following orders from lord sidious aka the chancellor oh no yeah palpatine and the cameron owen successfully cover five's discovery up by drugging him causing him to go a little crazy and then pretending he attacked palpatine thus making the jedi believe that the clones will go violent and berserk without their inhibitor chips in and ultimately this arc ends in five's tragic death as he's gunned down by his own brothers it's one of the greatest stories the clone wars ever told with an unprecedented sense of eeriness to the proceedings because of its inevitable outcome we know fives's mission to warn the jedi can't be successful since order 66 does eventually play out as palpatine intended so it's especially tragic to watch this story and see just how close the jedi were to learning of palpatine's plot the existence of order 66 at this point in the canon heightens the dramatic power of this arc but the reverse is true even more so this story does wonders to make order 66 so much more compelling by introducing the concept of the inhibitor chip it reframes the clones as victims in order 66 they never wanted to betray their jedi generals the heroes they fought alongside for years in battle after battle conflict after conflict we've had five seasons worth of clones and jedi working together and bonding so to know it all gets thrown away in a heartbeat once palpatine flips the switch in their brains that causes this massive betrayal is just beyond heartbreaking this arc also enhances the disturbing power of order 66 through the use of two recurring lines the first one being good soldiers follow orders tupp keeps repeating this line before and after killing his jedi general and it's so alarmingly cold and robotic he seems entirely entranced as he says it unable to form any other thought all that matters to him is the order the directive to kill all jedi that he needs to follow in order to be a good soldier and this one line is so perfectly indicative of the horror of order 66 from the clone's perspective their free will their ability to think for themselves at all has been snatched away in an instant they've been reverted back to their original programming which necessitates pure obedience to every order without question it's a terrifying thought the idea that these troopers we've grown to love over the course of this series were not only mere pawns insidious quest for total galactic control but completely unwitting pawns at that well maybe not completely unwitting the second recurring line in this arc is a reference to the mission the nightmare in every clone's dreams top speaks about it to fives as he dies and then five speaks about it to rex during his own death the revelation that the clones are all subconsciously aware of the order is gut-wrenching deep in the back of their minds they know it's coming one day but they're powerless to stop themselves from carrying it out the only escape from executing order 66 is death top and fives express relief at finally being free of the horrific nightmare or rather premonition of what their futures hold if that doesn't bring a whole new angle of tragedy to order 66 then i don't know what does it fits in so perfectly without retconning anything we can watch this scene knowing that cody never wanted to betray obi-wan and order him shot down it was all the machinations of the chip but like yeah we know that's what's going on in canon now but we also know that that's not how this scene was originally filmed the inhibitor chips didn't exist back when george initially wrote revenge of the sith and even if that was his idea for why the clones betray the jedi it definitely doesn't come across at all in this movie you essentially need knowledge of the tv show that came out years after the fact to appreciate the full range of the tragedy at play here and that's not ideal i'm not gonna lie still for years revenge of the sith was all we had in terms of canon visual depictions of order 66. like i said earlier the disney buyout resulted in the cancellation of clone wars before it could reach its intended conclusion a depiction of order 66 from the perspectives of ahsoka and captain rex two characters invented for the clone wars show that didn't appear in revenge of the sith but for many years following the airing of the clone wars sixth and final season we never got to see that unfold on screen season six dropped a bombshell on us in terms of the inner workings of order 66 without the show ever getting a chance to portray the event itself on its own terms in a post-inhibitor chip canon the idea of ever seeing new depictions of this tragic moment seemed entirely implausible thanks in no small part to the franchise's new corporate overlords appearing to shun all prequel content in favor of hardcore pandering to the original trilogy it seemed like the end of order 66's story until it wasn't call it an altruistic miracle call it disney finally waking up and realizing that prequel nostalgia pandering was just as lucrative as original trilogy nostalgia pandering but whatever the reason disney announced that the clone wars would be given one last season and in it a chance to finally conclude with its intended final arc depicting the siege of mandalore and order 66. like most clone wars fans i was ecstatic but little did i know that this announcement was just the first piece of what would become a renaissance of order 66 content and in fact there was one other visual disney era depiction of order 66 that came out beforehand but before we talk about all this heavy stuff let's take a break to talk about websites you know the thing fives could have used to publish his findings about the inhibitor chip in order to stop order 66 before it started that's the

and when you're ready to launch go to squarespace.com10 off your first purchase of a website or domain jedi fall in order is a game where you play as cal kestis a former jedi padawan who's gone into hiding in the five years following the jedi purge it's a pretty good game i played it when i first came out and i really enjoyed it throughout the game you occasionally flash back to your training with your jedi master and i didn't really think anything of it i was like okay that's a cute little flashback didn't seem necessary but it was nice i guess eventually you get to this one flashback where you're vibing with the clones on the way to your training it's cute to see cow being friends with these guys one of them even gives you a high five how wholesome you complete your training and make your way to your master where everything seems a-okay and then it happens are you okay i actually gasped when i saw this part it was obvious they were building up to this with the flashback scenes in hindsight but somehow this just threw me entirely for a loop when i first played this i saw these flashbacks as a chance to get some temporary relief from the horrors of cal's current reality but of course that didn't last we all knew going into this game that it wouldn't and yet i never would have expected this game to suddenly throw me into the shoes of a young padawan having to escape order 66. in my opinion this sequence is not only the best part of the game but a far more compelling depiction of order 66 than what revenge of the sith offered part of that is due to the interactivity of it all but you also have to give credit to the way it was built up to and framed by making it clear that the clones are cow's friends it makes their betrayal sting all the harder and by planting sidious's hologram in the background of the scene it better puts you into the shoes of these bewildered jedi jar to paul is having a terrifying vision and cal is concerned if his master is okay neither of them even notice that palpatine's order is what initiated this it perfectly reflects just how out of nowhere the whole situation was for the jedi running through the halls of the ship in constant fear of the clones catching you as you hear john williams brilliant order 66 score playing over everything is just such an indescribable feeling it's made even more potent by the fact that we got to know cal over the course of the game heightening the emotional investment of his urgent escape even more in the end his master is shot down dying right before him as one of the best music tracks from revenge of the sith anakin's dark deeds plays it's such a tremendously powerful sequence even if cal's scream at the end is a little bit silly so yeah between its buildup framing and unprecedented level of emotional investment this was pretty much the best canon interpretation of order 66 for about six months or so the final arc of clone wars is a masterpiece one of the greatest star wars stories of all time it flawlessly manages to simultaneously serve as a sequel to three of the show's greatest storylines maul's takeover of mandalore ahsoka's expulsion from the jedi order and our previous topic of discussion in this video the inhibitor chip mystery we all knew going in that this arc would overlap with the events of revenge of the sith and they make this fact explicitly clear multiple times throughout these episodes it's obvious throughout this siege of mandalore where ahsoka's leading troops in an effort to capture maul and free mandalore from his influence that these are indeed the end times throughout the second episode in this arc maul appears to be in constant fear of something some sort of major shift in the power dynamics of the galaxy that ties back to darth sidious we know what he's talking about but ahsoka and her allies don't and that's one of the many reasons this arc is so potent because not only do we know that order 66 is gonna happen sooner or later but also it's an event so horrifying that it has maul of all characters constantly on edge this seemingly fearless ruthless sith lord is terrified out of his mind over what sidious has in store so much so that after being bested by ahsoka in combat he begs her to let him die screaming hysterically at her and the clones maul is finally captured but nothing about the following proceedings are celebratory the tension at the beginning of the third episode in this arc is so palpable we got this eerie haunting music paired up with these incredibly long takes and throughout it all you just can't look away you keep thinking is this gonna be the moment it finally happens more than anything this is an episode that knows exactly what it has in terms of its story content and uses brilliant directorial techniques to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the first 10 minutes ahsoka and rex have a brief conversation reflecting on the war and how despite all the horror and heartbreak it caused at least it allowed the clones to exist and for rex and ahsoka to be friends and it's like man we know what's coming the build up here is even more heartbreaking than it was in jedi fallen order because in that case we only just got to know cal and we don't know the clones that betrayed his trust but here we've had a whole series getting to know ahsoka and rex we know what they've been through together we know how much they trust each other and yes due to the existence of star wars rebels we know it ultimately will work out for them in the end but that doesn't lessen the supreme power of this one paradigm shifting moment execute order 66 the way rex's pupils dilate as if he's been possessed the way he shakes and drops his helmet to the ground the way he resists the chip's programming just long enough to tell ahsoka to find fives and uncover the truth all of this done with no music just eerie silence before the chip finally forces him to shoot resulting in the same blaring tragic music we heard as cal mourned his master the track anakin's dark deeds has become somewhat of an anthem for this terrifying event and it's a perfect encapsulation of the pure horror felt by everyone involved while revenge of the sith portrayed order 66 and then swiftly moved along to cover palpatine's declaration of the empire and the conclusion of anakin's fall these two final clone wars episodes are allowed to fully focus on order 66 and allow it to hold even greater dramatic weight than ever before after ahsoka learns the truth she captures rex and removes his inhibitor chip meaning we not only get a jedi's reaction to this event but a freed clones as well and seeing such a stoic and strong character like rex cry at the thought of having to kill his brothers is just brutal that's not even mentioning how the animation on the clones is specifically designed to be more robotic once the chip kicks in or the insane dramatic irony of the helmets depicting ahsoka's markings now belonging to unwitting mindless drones forced to shoot her down the final episode also makes surviving order 66 look like the near impossible feat that it was in canon like by comparison it makes it seem like obi-wan and yoda's clones didn't really try that hard to take them out no one could have survived that fall my ass now i don't want to diss the original scene too much it's good and it laid the groundwork for all order 66 content we have now but everything about the final two episodes of clone wars speaks to a true evolution of the directorial and storytelling capabilities of order 66. everything from the slow methodical tension-filled build-up to the raw power of the moment it finally happens to the ensuing nail-biting escape and ultimately the supremely tragic aftermath the burial of these heroes who became victims of a cruel plot in their last moments this arc serves as one of the greatest series finales ever made while also doing full justice to the concept of order 66. that's where i figure the depictions of this event would end but little did i know there was still more to come the first episode of the clone wars spin-off show the bad batch opens in the same way any clone wars episode would with exciting narration introducing us to the context of the battle we're about to see it's a simple clones versus droid skirmish with master depa billaba and her padawan caleb commanding the clones hey he looks familiar i wonder where he's from anyway the bad batch come in direct up and all is well except the opening narration made it clear that we're in revenge of the sith territory timeline wise and so once again we get to see order 66 depicted this time from the perspective of kane and jaris and once again it starts with sheer silence when the order is given before transitioning to dramatic music once kanan realizes what's going on we hear certain parts of anakin's dark deeds mixed in with a new score or maybe it's a returning score from rebels i honestly wouldn't know i never finished it but ultimately the lava is shot down as kanan runs off now this depiction of this scene is different from a comic that previously portrayed it which is weird and i kind of like the comic version a bit better but i also just wanted to stick to the main visual interpretations of order 66 for this video ultimately both versions of how this scene went down are great and enhance the scenes in rebels where kanan has to be reminded of order 66 and all the pain betrayal and heartbreak he felt back to the bad batch they are oddly enough just as confused as the jedi they don't know what order 66 means and they want to go help kanan except for crosshair who fires a kanan and repeats those chilling words good soldiers follow orders it's such a potent way to reveal that crosshairs inhibitor chip is actually working even while the rest of the bad batch's chips seem to be broken after kanan manages to escape thanks to hunter covering for him the bad batch is called back to kamino where they notice all the clones acting strange cold robotic the bad batch try to make sense of why the clones turned on master bilaba and i find this conversation so compelling because it's our first glimpse at how clone troopers with their original personalities and values before the inhibitor chip wipes those out would react to order 66. i'm sure any of the other clones we met over the course of the previous series would have similar conversations if their programming allowed for it but of course it doesn't and that's what tech correctly theorizes is the reason for the clone's sudden betrayal and robotic nature programming the cameron owens performed on them that doesn't affect the bad batch because of their unique enhancements and yet it still managed to affect crosshair who continues to argue that hunter let kanan escape and that they should have just followed orders without questioning them it makes for such a compelling conflict between a half brainwashed clone and his non-brainwashed comrades again a whole new angle to view order 66 from that's about it in terms of discussing the bad batch the inhibitor chips do have lasting consequences in later episodes but we pretty much covered everything surrounding order 66 in this show anyway that seems like it should be it in terms of modern order 66 interpretations right no idiot we have to talk about everyone's favorite show the book of boba fett features an entire episode mostly dedicated to luke skywalker training baby yoda if that doesn't tell you what a gigantic this show was i don't know what will but this episode features a flashback grogu has to order 66. there's not really a whole lot to say here it's just clones shooting jedi from grogu's perspective it's interesting to see how he suppressed this traumatic memory for so many years and i feel like we might see more of this flashback in the future since we still don't know who saved him from the jedi temple so i guess that's an indication that new interpretations of order 66 are gonna keep coming out we've had four in the past four years and the more new star wars stories get told the more angles we'll potentially get to see for this paradigm shifting event so now let's bookend things and return to that original scene from revenge of the sith it's still the same scene as it was back in 2005 but it really does feel much more meaningful and significant these days now when i watch it i'm invested in the characters dying and the ones being forced to carry out the order plus i not only see the jedi on screen but i picture ahsoka cal kanan grogu rex jesse all the new characters we've grown to love over the years since this movie came out who all suffered at the exact same time don't get me wrong all this supplemental material enhancing the story being told in this movie doesn't automatically make the movie itself better but it does make the viewing experience better and more impactful and i can't help but get emotional with this scene nowadays i mean it's a well constructed scene even if you hate the movie overall and you don't have the context for all the new order 66 material the cinematography and editing are really strong the music is beyond phenomenal it's a good strong scene definitely not the best depiction of order 66 in the entire series but it did the extremely important job of laying the groundwork for some of the most amazing scenes and stories in all of star wars it took a while for this moment to reach its full dramatic potential but it was absolutely worth it in the end and like i said this might not even be the end for order 66 i can't wait to see what other horrific compelling depictions of it we'll get in the future anyway if you enjoyed this video and want more revenge of the sith content i'm also releasing a long ass youtube poop of the movie and it's supplemental material today on my second channel

political process to see Palpatine's   scheme unfolding right before their eyes -- Oh hey, maybe they could start a YouTube channel! So his evil scheme... is he really 
wants Queen Amidala to sign a paper. I have never known the plot of this movie until 
now, after having watched this movie for 20 years. Okay... I don't get it Imbeciles!! Unfortunately, Palpatine isn't the 
type to just drop out of the sky   and announce his plan to destroy civilization: ""You are about to die at the 
hands of the children of Thanos."" Why should he? He's got the 
Republic exactly where he wants it and the Jedi think the Sith's return is -- ""Impossible. The Sith have 
been extinct for a millennium."" A millennium is a long time 
to be planning revenge. That would be like if the descendants of Genghis 
Khan came back now to take revenge on... Russia? When the Sith went extinct, it was clearly at 
the hands of a dangerous capable Jedi order and it sounds like whatever happened then 
is part of what created the Republic: ""This republic has stood for a thousand years..."" That's why the Jedi seem so confident. And yet the Sith seem pretty 
sure of themselves, too... ""At last we will reveal ourselves to 
the Jedi. At last we will have revenge."" That's because the Jedi order has lost a step. Now they're just an inflexible hierarchy making 
arbitrary decisions from a literal ivory tower. ""The Force is strong with him.""
""He is to be trained then?""  ""No. He will not be trained."" Whatever they were before, there's 
little more than a ghost left of it now. As Dave Filoni says, this sense that 
the Jedi have lost their mission   is what makes Qui-gon's death so tragic. ""What's at stake is really 
how Anakin's gonna turn out because Qui-gon is different than the rest 
of the Jedi and you get that in the movie and Qui-gon is fighting because he 
knows he's the father that Anakin needs but instead of that father, Anakin gets this one ""The Chosen One the boy may be,   but agree with your taking this boy 
as your Padawan learner I do not."" ""The rest of the Jedi are so detached 
and they've become so political that they've really lost their way and Yoda starts to see that in the second 
film but Qui-gon is ahead of them all that's a failing for Anakin he doesn't have the the family that he 
needs so he's left completely vulnerable. ""What will happen to me now?"" Palpatine steps into that 
role of guidance for Anakin filling his head with a very 
different idea of destiny: ""You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met. 
I see you becoming the greatest of all Jedi."" ""I will be the most powerful Jedi ever."" And since Anakin's relationships 
grow increasingly strained,   both with the Jedi Council and with Obi-wan Palpatine is the only person who 
truly believes in Anakin's potential ""They've finally given you an 
assignment. Your patience has paid off."" In fact, he's essentially the only person from the 
entire Republic who's ever shown him any support. ""The republic's anti-slavery laws--""
""The Republic doesn't exist out here."" In many ways the Prequels are 
the story of an arrogant religion who get a hold of the messiah and then 
accidentally hand him over to the devil. The war doesn't go well, either. What we get to see of the 
Clone Wars... is pretty sick. There's a reason people wanted more of it. Like a lot more of it This is a really good show, by the way. 
I wonder why it's so -- oh that's right. But for the story Lucas was telling, 
the only things that really matter   about the Clone Wars are how 
they begin and how they end. That's certainly all that matters to Palpatine. You know the funny thing about this promise? ""I will not let this republic be split in two."" He kept it. There were never two sides to the war Of course it looks like you have 
Dooku and the Separatists and Grievous versus the Jedi and the clones and the Republic, but the reality is, all of these 
people are fighting for the same guy. It was a proxy war. It was a sham. A manufactured crisis that made 
hypocrites out of the Jedi: ""We're keepers of the peace not soldiers."" Destabilized planets across the galaxy: ""We are being held hostage"" And extended the range of Palpatine's control. Listen to the music here: This is the birth of the Empire This is why Palpatine plunged 
the galaxy into the fog of war   and made peacekeepers forget their purpose. Politics. And the Jedi just stood by and watched -- 
seemingly ignorant of the real game being played. They totally missed the importance of -- uh wait 
it's here somewhere -- oh yeah: The Chosen One. The Jedi's fate is inextricably 
connected to Anakin's,   and who is the only person he trusts? Not them. ""My trust in them has been shaken."" But they don't see this. They 
don't see a lot of things. They kind of look like idiots honestly. ""Chancellor Palpatine Sith 
lords are our specialty."" They don't notice when Palpatine uses 
Anakin to siphon their power away. And when they finally discover the truth, 
they rush in in a very unjedi-like manner. They just assume that it's gonna go the 
same way it did a thousand years ago. And the Jedi council's rejection of Anakin. ""You're on this council, but we do 
not grant you the rank of master."" Comes back to haunt them. When Palpatine activates Order 66 the Jedi who scoffed at the idea of 
the Sith's returning from extinction   are annihilated in a matter of minutes most of them never knowing how 
deep their failure truly went. And now the path was clear for Palpatine to 
become emperor ""with thunderous applause."" He promises the galaxy: Although we get to see the fates of those who 
Palpatine previously promised security to. ""Lord Sidious promised us peace!"" Palpatine's final victory is 
almost unmatched in its scope Revenge of the Sith is like a 
renaissance painting of judgment day where the Republic's political and 
spiritual powers crumble into nothing and its hero tries to murder his wife, 
before crossing swords with his brother,   and being consumed by wrath and when it's all over Palpatine swoops 
into hell like the angel of death and Darth Vader is born as the last person in the galaxy who still 
believes he has any good in him dies. Who is Palpatine's competition exactly? Satan? Because that's basically who Palpatine is. He dragged the most promising 
Jedi down to the fires of hell returning him to the state 
of slavery he was born in as a machine with a skull 
where his face used to be. ""And I'm telling you this 
finale it's unbelievable. How tepid contemporary art seemed compared 
to the passionate quality of this finale. So you have this like huge 
like romantic nature painting the apocalyptic landscape of the lava. Then Lucas cross cuts to the 
destruction of the senate chamber and you have the destruction of industry going on and then after all these 
horrors -- it is so beautiful I'm saying my god! Nothing in the last thirty years in 
any of the arts has been produced,   as emotionally compelling and significant as the finale of Revenge of the Sith."" In other words the only thing that 
eclipses the scope of Palpatine's villainy   is the scope of Star Wars itself. "

346,exdrZa-k0GY,2018-05-04T15:00:54Z,Avengers: Infinity War: An Unbridled Praise,"So, I figured since I make a lot of content that is negative about film, I had an idea to try and create a sister series to my Unbridled Rages. 

The idea is to try and praise the film for the things I thought were great while leaving the flaws out of the analysis, basically the complete inverse of what you often see on the channel. 

I will pick this back up with other films if you guys enjoy it, I really tried to nail the editing and the script though I wanted to get it out quick to cover the topic. 

Marvel really did pull something amazing off here, a flawed series but an unprecedented one none the less.

Let me know how you feel about the video o/",what you thought I hated everything [ __ ] now infinity war opens right after the events of Ragnarok the Asgardians were funneled onto a transport ship and now that same ship has been torn in half and set alight with fan s's warcraft looming over it Heimdall is injured with corpses littered about him Thanos's black order of swept through half of the ship leaving very few alive he then gets to share his perspective he talks about attempting to stop destiny in its arrival in this case referring to himself Loki is asked to provide the tesseract or he will witness the death of Thor but of course Loki doesn't care about Thor he even encourages his death until he starts to hear his brother's screams and Loki breaks begging Thanos to stop Thor admits that the Asgardians don't have the tesseract regardless it was lost when Asgard was destroyed though Loki could not refuse the opportunity for power the temptation of being something more stems back to the earliest moments in his past to prove the father than I and the worthy son you can't kill an entire race and now it gets Thanos exactly what he wants despite the dire situation Loki is optimistic and Thanos tries to comment on how misplaced that is only to hear Loki's reasoning echoing stock from so long ago the hulk then bursts onto the scene and begins to assault Thanos landing several hits and getting him into a corner only for Thanos to turn the fight with just a selection of well-placed counters he knocks the Hulk to the ground beaten bloodied and unconscious a position graver than we've ever seen the Incredible Hulk Thanos is extremely powerful he's extremely dangerous Heimdall then grips his sword and channels dark magic in a last-ditch effort to save banner with the Bifrost and send him back to earth as a result Thanos then executes him much to Thor's dismay Fanus then adds the space stone to his gauntlet alongside the power stone that he acquired from Xander and his Black Order is sent to find the two stones on earth while he finds the two that remain on other planets as of this information Loki offers his services to act as a guide through earth but Thanos claims his experience is failure in response Loki attempts to share his achievements claiming his rightful kingship of Jotunheim his position as Prince of Asgard the god of mischief and his title as Odin's son with a look to his brother remembering who he is Loki lunges at Thanos but the gauntlet prevents him from landing the strike as a result Loki as the life choked out of him by Thanos the camera slowly pans to a broken Thor lying atop Loki's corpse the two had their differences but in the latest iteration they actually managed to find some peace but now he's gone Thor has now lost every family member half of what remained of his people and his best friend only to be abandoned on his ship as it's blown to hell Thanos just beat the Incredible Hulk in one-on-one combat he strangled the main villain of the Avengers he has a gauntlet with the might of space and power and he decimated the Asgardian people the game has changed we then see the Hulk has been transported directly to cama tosh much to the surprise of wong and dr. strange who are now a part of a bigger world i'm doll likely sent banner here because he is of Earth and Kamaraj is a refuge a place with enough power to disrupt even a god I have been falling Bruce then warns the doctor that Thanos is coming we then see Tony telling pepper that he had a dream where they had a kid together and his life with her was moving forward but he woke up to realize that it was all taken away they've planned a date for their marriage but peppers worried about Tony's decision to keep a new unit so close to the chest Tony says it's simply protection not like before the consistent struggle between pepper and Tony is his attachment to being a hero many times he doesn't have to be the one that protects the world it can even be a detriment yet he will always feel that he has to be and he will often choose that over his life with her so Tony says no more surprises and that should be a promise but before he can make it they're interrupted by a portal with dr. strange exiting he wants Tony's help in saving the universe before Tony can make sense of the situation he is reunited with Bruce Banner an old friend that Tony's been without since the events of age of Ultron Wong then explains that when the universe was created 6 elemental stones that each controlled an essential aspect of existence were created with Thanos looking to combine them all Banner explains that Thanos is behind the attack on New York and he is coming here himself only for Tony to say this is it this is the end game for the Avengers this will be their greatest challenge this is what drives them to Tony's nightmare in age of Ultron knowing what is to come for his people after the road he's led them down Tony suggests destroying the time stone and strange says that they have not only taken an oath to defend the stone with their lives but that it might be an effective weapon against Thanos which leads them to butt heads quite significantly [Music] dony stark and Stephen strange are both very much egocentric characters sure of their own perspective and happy is the top protector of Earth so watching them clash is exactly as satisfying as you would imagine they decide to try and find vision as he is the mind stone and Tony says that Steve Rogers might be able to help Bruce is almost confused at the idea that they can't simply contact Steve and Tony shares with him that they've been through a breakup a lot has happened since banner has been gone they fell out hard and it's tough to open a dialogue but as if to reaffirm the idea that logic is forgotten when it to the heart banner reminds Tony that Thor is gone and who Tony is or isn't talking to doesn't matter when the universe is at stake but before Tony can complete a call to Steve with the phone he gave him two years ago something arrives just outside Wang dr. strange banner and Tony make their way through a panicking City and see the arrival of two members of the Black Order meanwhile Peter Parker notices the descending ship and suits up for the coming fight and we get two fantastic lines one way Peter asked Ned to cause a distraction so he can get into the fight and immediately Ned simply does this that's just fantastic on top of that the two members of the Black Order arrived with the telekinetic making an announcement that earth should rejoice only for Tony to cut him off and dr. strange to add a threat that's just fantastic Bruce then attempts to bring up the Hulk but he can't no matter how hard he tries and Tony says something else [Music] that's just a fantastic comedic line on its own but it's another insight into how much Tony wants to perform in front of these new powerful beings to show that there is a reason that he and his team were the protectors of Earth before strange even began fighting that combined with the idea that he actually doesn't take these enemies that seriously he's convinced that he can just knock them out but the final layer being that it's a tongue-in-cheek reference to the matter of how ridiculous it is that they are grounded comic-book heroes in this realistic will despite their nonsensical abilities and circumstances Rousseau's clearly showing that they are once again fantastic at understanding these characters while injecting some hard-hitting comedy Iron Man then suits up with nanotechnology allowing him to regenerate his suit over time if it's lost and spawn weaponry at hand this gives him a great advantage compared to his past suits he even blasts away whereas essentially the equivalent of evil Hulk with relative ease Doctor Strange realizing the Hulk isn't going to arrive then portals banner out of the fight soon after Ironman Wong and Doctor Strange all engaged the two members of the Black Order Ironman is squared away with evil Hulk while strange fights Squidward by the man then prevents Iron Man from getting smashed into the ground and begins fighting alongside him as a form of update on what's happening Iron Man sums up the situation for Peter as this brilliant Doctor Strange then attempts to use the time stone to win the battle against Squidward but his hands are bound before he can finish the spell yet he is very confident because of the dead man's lock he's got placed on the eye of agamotto this means it'll be locked to anyone attempting to open it especially if they kill Strange he was likely casting that when they began this fight and so Squidward ops to make strange unconscious instead and captures him while spider-man tries to prevent it Ironman then makes his way to the space donut with spider-man has already tried to keep up with Doctor Strange and he's losing his ability to breathe as spider-man falls he's picked up by Iron Man's own upgraded iron spider design we saw back in homecoming then he is promptly sent home Tony doesn't want Peter in danger arriving on the ship and calming down the situation Tony gets a call from Pepper telling him to come back telling him he shouldn't be on the ship Tony apologizes but he has the knowledge the power and the will to act he doesn't have a choice banner then decides to put a call in to Steve with the same phone II saw earlier an rubberband man begins to play leading the scene transition to the entry into the Avengers for the guardians of the galaxy they're getting along as any dysfunctional family can do responding to a distress signal and sharing banter in between quill even comments on potentially stealing the distress ship after Drax suggests it and that motivates rocket for the mission but quill immediately back tracks on that line the moment Gamora acknowledges it showing a great back and forth between all of them including a now teenage group playing defender on a portable console it is unbelievable that the writers have a strong understanding of so many different characters from so many established stories of their own with their own styles taking advantage of every last piece of dialogue it shouldn't be possible yet here we are Peter quill tells them to put on their mean faces as they arrive at the aftermath of the Asgardian massacre the distress signal originated from here soon after Thor slams right into this ship Drax can't help but refer to Thor as what seems to be an angel having made a baby with a pirate and I can't help but appreciate how god damn good the dialogue is join us mightiest heroes not today so are you making your voice deeper mantas then peers into Thor's mind saying he is feeling grief sorrow anxiety anger and guilt once Thor has been provided a blanket and some food he then lets the guardians know what has happened Gamora then provides an explanation Thanos wipes out half the population of any collection of humanity he finds to maintain a balance that can sustain the resources for far longer something he did to Drax his people and many others he now hopes to do it on a universal scale Thor's then convinced that there's only one place he can go to craft a weapon powerful enough to kill the mad Titan therefore he will need the help of the Guardians to go to new devaglia and craft a weapon in the same foundry that Mjolnir was created the Guardians decide to split up Thor takes what he refers to as rabbit and tree while the rest go to nowhere in order to cut off Thanos from collecting another stone we then cut to Scotland and we can see that Scarlet Witch is trying to test living a life with vision after much of what they've both been through it's time for peace to explore what they feel try to make something normal out of the chaos they both sprang from over the two years it would seem that they have grown quite close visions mine stone is causing him great discomfort and he says it's as if he can communicate with it he asks Wanda to interact with the stone and she says all she can feel is him we then see they're making their way to the train station as Wanda wants to leave they have both made promises to other people vision then struggles to say that he once wanted to stay and that they work their relationship works only to be interrupted by a report that Tony Stark is missing and an alien ship invaded New York this prompts vision to leave but both he and Wanda are taken off-guard by the two remaining members of the Black Order one looks like a goblin from Lord the Rings maybe the other looks like an enemy from a ps2 well ps3 ps4 game vision is impaled by the alien sphere and is now unable to phase but Wanda rescues him from the removal of his stone he spends much of the fight protecting him from the adversaries despite his protests and goes to show just how powerful she's become especially when motivated by love vision asks her to leave but she remains resolute in taking on both members of the Black Order though she doesn't have to be alone as the other Avengers enter the scene cap Falcon and Black Widow all assault the two until they flee to their doughnut and we get to see a thankful vision saved by Steve despite the last encounter they had this is once again developing that now is the time for a united front the smaller issues have to be put aside the next scene shows us what it's like to be in a massacre ordered by Thanos in this flashback we see gamora's homeworld being assaulted by an army of Chitauri slaughtering the fleeing civilians tearing apart a planet while the black order act as soldiers and spokesman for the will of Thanos a young Gamora shows ferocity while being pushed to a large group of soon to be executed civilians and Thanos picks her out offering to help her he shows of what looks like a toy and yet conceals a knife perhaps an allegory for how fast she lost her childhood to become an assassin under Thanos Thanos tells her that balance is important if there is too much on one side then it fails at the same time gamora's people are executed in the background making a very clear point about how he views his actions Thanos turns her head and so begins their father-daughter relationship this is treated as a memory Gamora is concerned about and she warns quill that they will meet Thanos eventually no matter what and if she's captured by him Peter needs to kill her to stop Thanos from getting information he needs at first Peter doesn't take her seriously but then she begins to shed a tear and asks that he swear on his mother an extremely important detail and so Peter agrees will Drax mantis and Gamora then make it to nowhere in quill commands them all to perform certain moves but is ignored with a neat detail of mantis actually walking along like a praying mantis they overhear Thanos attempting to get the reality stone from the collector and Drax begins to slip into a rage seeing the man responsible for so much death on his home planet and he prepares to attack him just like he did with Ronan Peter explains that they don't see the stone and if they get it first they can stop Thanos and despite that being true Drax cannot contain his heart and ignores quill something that might be very relevant later mantis puts Drax to sleep and the third of his body alerts Thanos to their arrival Gamora then takes point and out maneuvers Thanos until giving him a strike to the neck with a sword and a strike to the heart with a knife from the flashback as Thanos falls to the ground he simply asks why why would his daughter do this and Gamora can only lose herself in pain watching what she knows is a creature she may have actually loved in some way bleed out calling for her Thanos then reveals that he was using the reality stone to manipulate the very world around them revealing that nowhere has been set aflame and that he's not in fact dead Thanos was waiting for Gamora to arrive as he wanted what information she has alongside the fact that he wanted an answer for whether or not she actually cared about him as he does her but that moment Drax charges Thanos only to have the reality manipulated once again and he's turned to rubble alongside mantis being turned to ribbons leaving quill to standoff with a nose and his captured Gamora quill is torn at the prospect of killing the woman he's come to love but she reaffirms that he promised quill is reduced to a threadbare realization that he has to kill her and so he pulls the trigger Thanos reduces Peters blast to bubbles with the reality stone at the moment he pulls the trigger and let school know that he actually really likes him this entire time Fanus was simply curious if he would come through to do what was needed it was a test with that fairness this captive through a portal and the Guardians recover from the reality shift we then see rody discussing the aftermath of civil war with Ross stating that the criminals he once captured are only labeled that way because of Ross placing that label on them road even cites the events of civil war being the reason for visions disappearance his conflict Ross counters with the fact that Rhodes is one of the many who signed the Accords and Rhodes makes it clear that he has paid his dues for that after the accident I doubt he feels like defending the Accords all that much but he has gotten some use of his legs back with the same style of tech we saw in Civil War Ross then says the world is on fire but that doesn't change what happened in Civil War these people are still criminals and they are still under arrest Rhodes then cuts the call with Ross and has chosen to fight outside of the law with cap to defend the world this completes a significant arc for a small character Rose used to force the law on heroes under the jurisdiction of the government a government he believed in now that willed is at stake and the government still wants to imprison the world's heroes when they are trying to save it because they won't work for them Rhodes has now lost his faith and will fight with the heroes instead Bruce Banner then slowly enters the room and it falls silent except for him and NAT saying each other's names the last they saw each other that wasn't easy and I'm sure she holds some form of a grudge as does he falcon then cuts through the tension with a comment on just how awkward it all is but there isn't time to discuss it the team talked about the current situation they talk about ant-man and Hawkeye having to take care of their families after the accords so they struck deals with the government with this information banner has to ask a rather simple question banner wasn't here for either of their introductions so it's a logical statement form to make and it's funny cuz it's true banner then explains that Thanos commands destructive armies and you will assault earth until he gets the stone from vision black widow demands that they protect it but vision counters and says they must destroy it he suggests that scarlet witch's power being that of the stone can overload it if she simply focuses enough breaking it down and thus preventing Thanos from using it Wanda says that vision would die without the stone and they're not going to have that conversation whether or not he's requesting that she be the one to kill him Steve then says that they will not exchange lives ever which is very much in line with his idea of valuing the individual far before anything else but as vision points out caps sacrificed himself to save everyone within a radius and vision suggest he'd die for the universe before cap can answer him banner suggests removing the stone from vision to then destroy it there is one place that is a secret to secretary Ross a place with the technology to pull this off and a place where they would have the knowledge to do it what Conda the film then takes us there and we see that Winter Soldier has entered the game with a brand new vibranium arm to boot back at the donut we see that dr. strange has been tortured by squidward demanding the stone to be released in preparation for the arrival at Titan Iron Man then spots dr. strange Escape is still here hoping to save him and on top of that drops in spider-man much to Tony's dismay they exchanged words on top of each other again and again was spider-man actually blaming Tony for making the suit so good that it allowed spider-man to be here which he immediately takes back and says plainly there is no way that he can defend his home if there is no home to defend finalizing his decision but Tony makes it very clear he didn't want him here because it is likely a one-way ticket Peter then concocts a plan in reference to the film aliens when Ripley blows the xenomorph Queen out of the airlock we see Iron Man blow Squidward out into space just as well with spider-man rescuing strange and the whole sealed the mission is complete and mere seconds later we find that Doctor Strange is not thankful for being saved and neither is Tony forthcoming about being right about his lack of definitive protection of the stone above all else the two characters clash heavily almost coming to blows because of how utterly narcissistic both of them are they are the smartest guy in the room and they both have the power to act on it strange wants to return home at the very least getting the stone as far away from Thanos as possible while Stark wants to take the fight to Thanos considering the destruction it brings to fight him on their own turf and they won't be expected they both exchange their perspectives about the other failing to understand the situation and it ends with strange making it very clear that he will absolutely allow Peter and Tony to die before allowing the stone to fall to Thanos Tony then provides Peter with an arbitrary knighting telling him he is now an Avenger despite it being so comical in nature with Tony finding it to be a chore Tom Hollands sells Peters appreciation for joining the team you can tell it's a dream come true for spider-man back on his ship Thanos has broken more of food sharing that he knows she hates the room the thrown and her life with him yet he wanted her to secede him he wanted her to feel like family he saved her from death to become something important the fiercest woman in the galaxy Gamora she is that her people were happy before he arrived as a counter Thanos tells her about her planet now compared to back then it was filled with starvation and misery but now it is reborn with happiness and the planet is thriving the deaths of half the population was a worthy price to pay for salvation resources of finite in the universe and thus reducing life before it completely spills over is the only way to create a lasting paradise for the living to which she is cut off by Gamora speaking for the audience by saying that Thanos cannot know that that is the definitive solution to the universal planet-wide misery and that ultimately he is insane he looks genuinely frustrated with her as if he knows why she feels like that but he can't explain the logic well enough so Fennell shrugs it off and says not only he's he the only one who knows that it's true he also is the only one who has the power and will to act on it sothe anis gets to his point and asks Gamora for the soul stone she initially refuses to provide Thanos any information lying about her lack of knowledge but once she hears the desperate screams of pain from her sister at the hand of Thanos she caves in and tells him what planet the soul stone is on and Thanos demands that she show him it doesn't matter what's at stake when your family is threatened you'll do everything to protect them and that's who these people are because I wanted to you were the one who wanted to win and I just wanted a sister we then cut to Thor explaining the plan to the rabbit but he'll go to the birthplace of Mjolnir and create a new weapon with the Forge powered by a neutron star but he goes quiet once the hammer is mentioned likely bringing up a past that Thor has yet to really deal with so rocket wrestles with the idea of talking him through it after establishing that every member of Thor's family has now been killed alongside his friends and home he begins to break but resolves to declare that he is strongly motivated to find vengeance he is certain that fate will deliver Thanos his death to him and he is asked what he will do if he's wrong I can't get over how much Thor's become a genuinely human character after one rather large retcon the writing done to make him not only grounded but strong and sympathetic echoes right on through this film with Chris Hemsworth doing a fantastic job bringing it to life the scene then moves on to the rabbit explaining an eye he stole after winning a bet which leads him to providing Thor with a replacement as much as it's a great moment to show that rocket is bonding with Thor it's more of a strong call back to the kleptomania that rocket engages in as well as this fascination with body parts [Music] athough thanks the sweet rabbit and they make their way to the foundry only to meet Tyrion who apparently works there 300 dwarves were wiped out by Thanos after Tyrion had created his gauntlet under threat Tyrion was spared for his creation but his hands were sealed shut though with help from Thor rabbit and tree he is certain they can create a weapon that will stop the nose we see that Iron Man Doctor Strange and spider-man have arrived at Titan meanwhile nebula has escaped and begins to head to Titan as well after being repaired by a Chitauri iron man then thanks strange for helping landing the craft and spider-man warns that there's something coming quill Drax and mantis then begin an assault in the characters clash and what is extremely satisfying combat countering strong heroes with weaker ones because of reasonable technology they then end up in a standoff and quill threatens to kill Peter at the thought alone Tony then threatens to blow off Drax his head if he even tries once they're able to calm down quill demands to know where is Gamora confused Iron Man says he can do one better who is Gamora and then and the entire cinema myself included lost the collective [ __ ] of that line Drax never [ __ ] changed me they eventually work out the confusion lay down their arms and begin to plan their attack on Thanos this scene has a massive amount of conflict between two very much alpha characters trying to figure out how they can communicate rather than what their plan is as Plan ears I think it's good except it sucks so let me do the plan and that way it might be really good Wow these references to classic films that both Peters would share for different reasons Tony getting utterly frustrated by the fact that some of them don't even know the definition of words he is using and all of it is shunted by dr. strange revealing that he's been peering into the future and there is only one outcome of over 14 million that results in their victory we then see that US has made it to the planet that houses the undiscovered stone which simultaneously acts as the home of Red Skull a man consumed by the search for power is now cursed to guide others to a power he can no longer possess Red Skull explains that the soul stone is not to be passed around like the others there is a certain requirement to it you must understand the gravity of the situation and sacrifice something dear in exchange for it a soul for a soul in order to understand just what you're trying to achieve this amuses Gamora because she knows that that us loves nothing his killing torture and conquest is halted by the universe itself Thanos cannot win she then realizes that he is shedding a tear because there is something in the world that he loves fairness has already realized that to achieve his goal he has to kill Gamora his daughter he finally had it back by his side but even now the thing that he values so much can't get in the way of his new goal Thanos remarks that he ignored his destiny once but never again Gamora even tries to kill herself but his reality stone won't allow it Gamora is then thrown from the precipice and in exchange for her death Thanos receives the soul stone we then see cap in his side of the Avengers have made it to Wakanda Bucky joins them and they get vision to Q she says that it is possible to remove vision stone but it'll take time then immediately following that Thanos his army begin to invade Thor and rabbit then start up the foundry in order to melt the materials required for the weapon but the main door allowing the light through needs to be held open by someone Thor decides to do it himself taking the full brunt of the star he manages to barely survive and once the hammer has been given its handle the magical weapon Stormbreaker is created we then see fan s's army launched upon Wakanda and everyone begins to shape a banner operating Veronica and blasting with both arms Falcon sweeping the battlefield alongside Rhodey cap Black Panther Michonne and natural preparing for the assault with an army of wakandans using the spears to fire bolts of energy almost as if the Russo brothers watched my Black Panther rage and retcon the spears into rifles because that makes sense whose primitive now Michonne the grunt start to circle the dome and out of worry for them being able to break in behind Black Panther opens the gate at the front so they have a way in and begin to flood instead of going around the sides the armies engage and we see a full charge led by both the American and wakandans super soldiers as they progress the swarm begins to overrun them all and writers hope seems lost Thor enters the battlefield and smashes down a huge blow of lightning with his hammer bringing him both rabbit and tree to turn the tide of the war we then cut back to tighten and Thanos has arrived he discusses the history of the planet with Doctor Strange remarking upon how this was his homeworld it was once beautiful but like all planets had had too many mouths to feed losing its resources to a detrimental level Thanos offered a solution a culling of 50% of the population at random dispassionate fair no difference between the rich and poor alike he was labeled a madman yet what he predicted came to pass dr. strange assesses that perspective as the desire to commit genocide with a wanton need for ending trillions of people's lives but Thanos counters with the simple fact that once he has the six stones he can end those lives in an instant with a snap of his fingers that would be mercy after that he can look out onto a sunset rest and appreciate that he was the only one that could have done this and he did it well the hardest choices require the hardest wills to which Doctor Strange engages a battle we see Iron Man drop a massive ton of rock on top of Fanus while launching a constant barrage Spider Man firing web with a collection of kicks and punches tracks getting slashes on Thanos his legs and quill firing shots throughout the fight with Doctor Strange supporting them all with shields portals and platforms before Thanos can make a full sense of the situation nebula bursts onto the scene ramming him into the ground with an escape pod immediately demanding to know where Gamora is and he is caught off guard each of the team begin to subdue him in their own way Peter stunning him spider-man webbing him Drax holding his legs down mantis attempting to make him sleep Doctor Strange bringing everything he's got around and on top of him and Thanos is neutralized but resisting the entanglement quill then takes the opportunity to get close and demand Gamora - which Thanos immediately responds my Gamora quill angered by the thought of her imprisonment again asks where she is gone a nebula quickly figures it out Thanos went to retrieve the stone with her and she didn't return before quill even realizes what nebula is saying Tony begins to beg him to stop and think to not react this is the most important moment of his life and he has to think clearly Tony recognizes the same fury that's about to take Peter that took him so long ago the Vengeance that might be righteous but it's a spiral of suffering the kind that doesn't allow logic to come into question quill demands to know if it's true and Thanos says he had to [Music] lost helpless and enraged for killing her quill attacks Thanos causing mantas to lose control resulting in each of the heroes losing their holds on him Thanos then quickly knocks out quill Drax and nebula with spider-man attempting to collect them all up before they hit the ground Thanos reveals dr. strange to be carrying an eye of agamotto with nothing inside he knocks him clean out leaving Iron Man as the last hero to stand in his way then Tony opens with the displeasure of having a moon thrown at him only to hear that owes call his name which is a fantastic piece of dialogue and we'll get to it Iron Man gives out everything missiles blast shields lasers clamps stuns rams and punches only to be beaten again and again until his armor begins to shed all over losing more and more pieces to drop more and more blood on the battlefield Tony moves a large portion of the Nano metal to create a spear and misses Thanos resulting in it being broken off reversed and used to impale him through the chest as Tony whimpers his lasting breaths Thanos says he respects him and hopes that he will be remembered by what remains of humanity once he is done but before he can deliver a killing blow to Iron Man Doctor Strange bargains for his life in exchange for the time stone Thanos agrees and leaves with the stone before anyone else can stop him all that's left is for Tony to are strange why he would do something like that thanassis army then engaged a huge set of underground grinders to assault our heroes and Scarlet Witch comes in to protect them leaving vision to be attacked by the Goblin banner then brings in Veronica to defend him and almost dies as the Hulk still refuses to help out but with quick thinking he attaches the removed arm to evil Hulk and sends him right into the wakandan dome to be obliterated vision is then impaled again leaving him weaker than ever and he's told that he is no formidable machine he's dying just like any other man only for Steve to come in and prevent the killing blow meanwhile Scarlet Witch Scarlett Johansson and Scarlett michonne all converge on the ps3 boss and toss her into one of the diggers splattering her for good cut back to cap who is losing the fight with the Goblin but while being strangled vision saves him cap says he told him to run and vision replies brilliant callback thought begins to mappable the ships as they flee the area with the remaining heroes being called in to protect vision from Thanos as if with ease Thanos slides through the Avengers sealing them in the environment or simply blasting them away wander then listens to vision beg her to kill him to save the world he says she's the only one who can it's not fair but she can't hurt him he will only feel her calling back to the earliest scene in the film and so Wanda begins to overload the stone losing any sense of composure she watches all of the Avengers fail to even slow down Thanos ending with Steve the first and last Avenger being knocked to the ground vision then says I love you as he is broken into pieces the stone along with him though Thanos isn't remotely concerned as he can now reverse time just as Doctor Strange did reforming vision along with his mind stone batting away wander Thanos on reaches into visions skull and pulls the stone from him killing him again Thanos is then at the point of achieving all six the might of mind soul reality time space and power together after a surge of light he's ready to click his finger Thor then arrives and his weapon manages to resist the power of the completed gauntlet throwing his axe to embed it deep into Thanos his chest despite that achievement and the revenge served by a long awaiting Asgardian Thanos still performs his task and thus begins the end for half of the world he then escapes into a portal of his making once he's left our remaining heroes begin to realize what has happened Captain Steve Rogers watches his 100 year old friend he defended to the death shatter into Ash right in front of him T'Challa finds his personal bodyguard a Koi a telling her that she needs to get up this is no place to die only to fade right in front of her to ash Groot is taken in front of rocket soldiers surrounding the battlefield are almost swallowed by this plague one that watches herself fall apart just before Falcon sees the same back on Titan Tony watches as mantis begins to fall away followed by Drax and quill confused he turns to dr. strange only for him to say there was no other way moments before turning to ash along with them and then he confused scared and desperate Peter Parker begs for help from Tony he feels unwell Tony tells him he's going to be okay he says he's sorry and falls away from Tony's arms Tony is left to realize that his worst nightmare has come true all of the work he committed to has fallen to ruin the film ends with a limping Thanos reaching the sunset he wanted once his task was complete a fulfilled man looking out satisfied over a job well done and that was Avengers infinity war and what an incredible [ __ ] film it was this is the first part of what commemorates ten years since Iron Man hit the theaters and such an insane amount of work has been completed since then this film is packed with so much care for a franchise of characters and storytelling that it's unbelievable we're in a time line that we got to see it we have fallout from Civil War direct continuity with Ragnarok a glorious suitable introduction for the Guardians as they joined the Avengers spider-man strange and black panther all serving character-driven roles protecting the people they've sworn to serve and our core team from back in joss whedon spectacle kicking just as much ass details like doctor strangest surgery scars are still visible rody is still injured ant-man and Hawkeye actually have reasons to not show up Thor arrived late to Thanos because he didn't have a transceiver the film makes an effort to show each of the heroes using them except him rocket comedic ilish airing that he still has a lot to lose compared to Thor and he loses all of it by the end Tony keeps the phone that Steve gave him on him at all times he is desperate to speak to his friend but he knows he can't not to mention that once Ironman is reported missing Steve says that Earth is in trouble as its lost its greatest hero the details of these two are fantastic and they don't even share a [ __ ] scene strange actively providing the stone despite the strict assessment that it's the last thing he would do telling the audience that this is a part of the plan especially considering that his last line was that it's the only way the world was set the characters arrived and suffered to a new villain only to blast expectations to smithereens so why does it work Thor since Ragnarok has been dealing with a set of heavy losses and now that he's at his wits end watching his people his best friend and his brother die at the hands of a horrifying cruel monster he's given his target as well as his opportunity to hunt them down with all of his might after acknowledging it all trying to accept it all he almost dies to craft a weapon that can give him an opportunity to take his vengeance and he gets it we got to see him crack down a battlefield with all the might of Asgard behind him he got to plow that axe deep into Thanos his chest and listen to the mad Titan wince in pain he may not have killed Thanos but Thor received power control and retribution for so many losses that he suffered over the series speaking of Thanos what a way to say [ __ ] you to the detractors claiming that Thanos will be a letdown of a villain you put the [ __ ] work in didn't you phallus is opening killing the god of mischief and beating the Hulk in one-on-one combat sets the stakes strong from the get-go you don't want to [ __ ] around with this guy but the little details of what make him so much more human than many of the characters in superhero films these days Thanos is absolutely consistent on his ideology killing only by what he defines as his design or when people stand in its way he actively explores other characters pursuing weaknesses in quill testing logic in Doctor Strange respecting the ingenuity and perseverance of Tony and discovering if Gamora still loved him you need to note that Thanos never lays a hand on Gamora he tries to feed her comfort her explain why he's doing what he is doing and after she said she hated to see the throne he takes a seat on the steps instead he even has nebula reassembled he doesn't need to do any of these things but he does them anyway it shows that Thanos loved Gamora he cared about her almost as much as his entire life's purpose there is something of a tragedy for Gamora to gloat that her father will suffer because he is nothing more than a monster only for her to realize that she now has to die because someone loves her once Thanos has achieved his goal he admits he had to lose everything but he couldn't allow history to repeat itself his planet was destroyed by overpopulation and the idea of killing 50% of the living creatures is not a button anyone can push no matter how right so he identifies himself as the one with the will to do it through that he has camaraderie with Stark the curse of knowledge the power to act on it in the will to commit it consumes you you become a pawn to your own ambition Thanos had to do it it will create the most salvation throughout the universe more so than anything else would he felt desperately that he was right and nothing was going to make him fail this time for the greater good he would even sacrifice his own beloved daughter despite these humanizing qualities these weaknesses and motivations he is still to be feared cosmically this creature kills if he needs to Ironman with his greatest technology was nothing more than a pinprick from his perspective Thanos is the protagonist the hero he will save the universe no matter what these beings do to him no matter how they attempt to lead this world to destruction you can argue against him as much as you want with whatever logic you think applies but Thanos will always look at you as a child who lacks the life experience necessary to understand why this is the only logical course of action for the benefit of the living Thanos has loved and lost like everyone else but now he has found a way to create the most mercy in the universe people won't understand it people won't like it nevertheless he will make the decision for them instead of waiting for them to reach the point of no-return only to realize he was right all along Thanos is one of the best realized villains across the MCU if not the best being gomorrah's father allowed the writers to inject him into an emotionally important role at the same time as making him definitive in his motivation and that connection he has to Gamora is only rivaled by quill from the moment he met Gamora he has been enamored with her in his own way after protecting her and subsequently almost dying for her he spends moments breaking her walls down dancing with her completely falling in love all of it leading to her being what is not only a partner but something to live for when quill has been faced with losing both of his parents and the man who raised him quill is an inherently emotional irrational man oftentimes jumping to an outlandish choice down to a singular piece of information it broke my heart to put that tumor and despite everything he's been through he still had her they were close enough for her to ask him to swear on his mother that he would end her life to protect her from Thanos that is a heavy request made out of love and when he gets the first chance of being able to rescue her from Thanos it's all torn away she's already dead she can't be dead the fury takes over costing him more than he will ever know Stark was lucky that Steve was able to stop him from crossing the line but nobody could stop Peter not when it was here we were finally given time to see vision and wander get their brief moments of peace together cheering a connection from being the outsiders of the Avengers from the day he saved her to his admittance of attraction vision has spent his time trying to be a hero like those who created him trying to come to a conclusion about his own life his purpose he wants to fight to preserve life he wants to help his friends and he wants to do it with Wanda the woman he loves they begin softly sharing their connection and restrained only for vision to suffer for every scene thereafter becoming weaker and weaker being impaled blasted and driven into the ground getting himself in more and more trouble by trying to defend others he decides to do the most mortal thing there is die to prevent the most suffering to ever threaten the universe like a hero and the only person who has the power to do it is the one that he loves Elizabeth Olsen has what I can only describe as an incredible performance selling the idea that she is killing the only person who made her feel normal again while he tells her he loves her and to watch the horror on both of them as its reversed to have visions very soul torn from his body what makes him so close to human what brought him to the gods that created him is pulled out leaving behind a cold shell sapped of its color all that's left is the machine it's horrific the powerful intelligent and heroic vision dies as a man but perhaps the most impactful moment goes to a particularly powerful road being drawn to its closed Tony Stark has been through a lot in his series of films finding that he must balance his urge to protect earth while living the life of a man leading him to protect his power nuke his power automate his power submit his power and finally to keep it as insurance to maintain a safety net if ever he or his loved ones were attacked but never in pursuit once he knows that this coming attack is what he's been waiting for for six years what sent him into anxiety attacks what has consumed him since he saw his vision he fights it to the point of leaving Earth's solar system and to the realization that Pepper the person he loves the most will never come between him and his we'll to prevent the suffering on a universal scale this is very much the reflection of Thanos himself with all that happening it's tough to realize that Tony is also dealt with the fact that his dad didn't love him as much as his work his mother or himself he'll he loved cat more Tony then sees the tape in Iron Man 2 that tells him his dad considered him his greatest achievement and his work was all intended to be left to him his dad absolutely loved him Tony couldn't share any real moments of closure or love with his father despite his desperation because they were killed by Hydra and attempt to steal his formula this destroyed what made Tony so callous as a man in the first place he needed to reevaluate the man he'd become moving on to civil war he treats Peter as a surrogate son brings him in only to tell him to leave the second he is visibly hurt Tony is looking to ignite that lost flame to get that relationship he's pined for his whole life taking a positive step in that direction in homecoming he keeps him in what is essentially a box despite spider-man's raw strength he only wants him fighting lowlife criminals because it's safe and he's a child mr. Parker nice work in DC my dad never really gave me a lot of support and I'm just trying to break the cycle when I'm complimenting you great things are about to happen what is that I'm at band practice that's odd he told me you quit band six weeks ago when Peter succeeds he congratulate sim shares with him that he always wanted this kind of relationship with his father that he's proud of what he's doing but then to subvert Tony's security he lies while trying to get involved in something Tony told him to stay away from Peter wanted to go behind Tony's back and avoid what was essentially his protection his care from this dad you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do those weapons were out there and I try to tell you about it but you didn't listen none of this would have happened if you would just listen to me do you know that I'm still only one who believed in you everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a fourteen-year-old kid he was furious and he took the gear back Peter didn't deserve to have it if he wanted to thrill seek but Peter saves the day and Iron Man's actual equipment from vulture without a suit and reasserting that he only wants to do good lying was the way that he saw an opportunity for it and that's why he did it Peter is reinstated and their relationship is strong once again in infinity war he decides to help because he can despite Iron Man's attempt to stop him he even goes on what can be assumed as a one-way trip because he wants to help people what if somebody had died tonight different story right because that's how you if you died Tony wants him gone because the last thing he can bear is watching the kid get hurt and so echoing the dream he has in the opening about a child with the woman he loves called Morgan taken away in a moment Tony has to watch as Peter has slowly turned to ash in his arms begging to stay with him all in a handful of seconds Tony loses one of his Avengers he sees an innocent boy trying to save lives perish but most importantly he has that new and loving fatherly connection severed again and there was nothing he could do to stop it but it falls on him everything falls on Tony Stark's conscience as he was alive to stop it and he couldn't Tony now loses the son he never had the team he built to protect the world and the universe itself nothing he could build or prepare could prevent it after six years of it festering in his head his nightmare is broken through Tony is frozen unable to emot-- he couldn't accept it before and now it's real everything has fallen apart this is it pair all of this with Tom Hollands heart-wrenching performance selling a Peter Parker that has begun to feel death coming after watching all the people he just saved - into ash he begs Tony not to let him go again and again while failing to stand fading away in his arms the scene was incredible the film itself is a culmination of many running stories and characters dealing with very human grief and disturbing events reaching conclusions simultaneously that could rival any kind of television series finale covering strong patterns of family love sacrifice and death characters giving in to the destruction of the universe to save the suffering of their brothers or sisters families coming to save the day only to be torn to shreds many characters having to sacrifice what they have come to love for the greater good and the death the rampant cold death of so many beloved characters the credits of this film play like an obituary the audience was dead silent a respectful end to a defeating story that still has more to come this began with Ironman but the original Avengers revealed the potential of this series those Avengers are a large portion of what remains for the heroes each dealing with their own issues are being set up to save the day to pass over the Marvel mantle to the new heroes that have been lost this isn't just a celebration of one film and its achievement to bring together so many of the properties with weight behind them this is a celebration of what has been accomplished with ten years of character writing ten years of trying to create something that people could become enamored with this spans completely different personality types completely different plots completely different settings completely different worlds directors having their style blasted through with writing having space and quality to shine incredible performances combined with special effects to support this comic book world's realism all of this took Talent time effort and passion Marvel should be [ __ ] proud of themselves drama and comedy are tough balance but throughout Marvel's series they've shown they're gonna shift it in one way or the other with infinity war being no exception this is not an entirely morbid affair and it does benefit from that I'm Peter by the way Doctor Strange Oh using your made-up names then I am spider-man they said we were going to open what conduct to the rest of the world this is not what I imagined or give you imagine the Olympics maybe even at Starbucks so cool we have rabbit trees Squidward blanket of death kick names and take ass I am Steve Rogers the baby of a pirate and an angel what was she doing up there the whole time I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off and who could forget this film was an event a triumph each of the crew and cast involved deserve a pat on the back for bringing a 10-year path to an incredible peak I can't even tell you about all of the amazing details this film has aside from what I've already discussed nor will I share any flaws I don't know if you noticed but this assessment is extremely biased in one specific direction to compliment my other recent work infinity war was a [ __ ] fantastic film and the Russo brothers proved once again that they know how to write a villain they know how to juggle extremely large important and controversial elements this is a man they understand the characters they are tasked to write for but most importantly they respect them giving the MCU fans the explosions powers and escapism we all look for with an added sense of reality to hit us right in the heart to make us feel for the fiction because in a dreary world beacons of hope and justice can offer some real comfort beings with absolute power choosing to help others is endearing and inspiring Marvel Studios have achieved something incredible unprecedented setting a record in more ways than one as a fan I couldn't be more impressed with the task they had and the product they created thank you for making something so [ __ ] awesome and thank you all for watching my video I can't wait to cover the sequel normally I do videos where I simply talk about the negatives of a film in a quick rant I decided to try and do the reverse with this one let me know if you liked it and if you'd like to see more I know a lot of people prefer the vitriolic hatred - let's say appreciation so again thank you for checking on my content folks and I will see you next time

352,gAD-VPpb1fo,2023-07-18T18:00:14Z,Palpatine Looks Nothing Like An Emperor And That's Great,Watch out everybody - I'm about to break new ground. This white male millennial with a YouTube Channel has OPINIONS ON STAR WARS.,what do you think when you hear the word Emperor okay now imagine we live in a world where pop culture franchises don't infect our every thought what would you think now probably something along these lines well-dressed well-coffed classy men with good posture and Regal bearing if you're ruling an entire Empire it's pretty important that you look the part these were the days before photography people wouldn't believe you were the emperor unless you wore fancier clothes than everybody else lived in a fancier house than everybody else and had more shiny things pinned to your chest than everybody else which is what makes this guy so interesting Star Wars iconic Emperor Palpatine doesn't appear in the original 1977 film he's obliquely referred to a couple of times but for the most part his Galactic Empire is represented To Us by his subordinates and for the most part those subordinates look appropriate to their positions snappily dressed and well-groomed fascist officers Who oversee galaxy-wide oppression with a stiff upper lip their uniforms are clean and pressed to give them a sense of efficient superiority but dull colored and unoramented to imply sterility and Conformity it's no secret that the costumes of the Imperial officers were inspired by the uniforms of the Third Reich probably the evilest real world Empire and living memory and they almost all have Upper Crust English accents which evokes the globe spanning British Empire that conquered people's Beyond count in short they look and sound like what you would expect of them they draw on historical visual parallels given a science fiction update to evoke the image of an Empire in space there's one guy who stands out and that's Vader with his angular black armor and floor length Cape but in the original Star Wars Vader comes off as the exception to the rule among an Empire with a very specific aesthetic in Star Wars media sense Vader is routinely portrayed as one of the Empire's top dogs but in the original film he comes off almost like an outsider officers question him and outright insult him to his face and he can be ordered around like his hired muscle remember that there's no mention of the Sith in the Original Trilogy all we know about the formation of the Empire is that it succeeded the Old Republic and that Vader a devotee of the dark side of the force sided with it over the Jedi Knights But A New Hope gives us the impression that this is largely an alliance of convenience that Vader is tolerated within the empire for his Effectiveness even as his religion makes him a target of mockery so imagine it's 1977 and you're my dad and you've seen the original Star Wars 17 times you might be wondering to yourself what this emperor of the Galactic Empire looks like and you'd probably expect something like this he'd probably look somewhat like Tarkin but with a bigger chest of medals he'd look Regal and clean-cut and respectable he'd certainly look more like his officers than like Vader who seems to be the odd duck in his regime but then Empire came out and we got our first look at the guy and then Return of the Jedi followed it and stuck to the same design though they recast the part with the now iconic Emperor actor Ian McDermott and this well this doesn't look like an emperor he wears a simple black robe he keeps a hood up over his face and he looks sickly and grotesque there's no reality or Majesty to him at all and not only does he not look like an emperor he doesn't even really look like he belongs in a science fiction film think about it if you cut Emperor Palpatine out of Star Wars and pasted him into Middle Earth would he look out of place at all there's nothing about his design that appears futuristic he'd be at home next to the ring wraiths what he really looks like is a witch he doesn't seem like someone who should be managing a vast Galactic bureaucracy he seems like he should be hidden away in a dark Lair working foul magic surround His cauldron he belongs in the Middle Ages not a high-tech space station and that's what's so damn cool about this character design because it makes us rethink our entire impression of what the Galactic Empire is this is not just any fascist government led by a charismatic strong man this is an institution that is in a spiritual sense evil at its core evil is not just a byproduct of its authoritarian ideology evil is the ideology because there is no way that this man is under any delusions about which side he's on in doing so it creates an inconsistency that's kind of difficult to address now I'm no expert on the Star Wars expanded universe so if you are tell me does Palpatine preside over the Senate and meet with diplomats and bureaucrats looking like this does he appear at State functions and on television looking like the goddamn Grim Reaper the bad batch says he does but Star Wars Rebels implies that he outwardly presents himself as a more proper looking emperor when speaking to those outside his inner circle which seems to make more sense because who could possibly accept being ruled by a man who openly Revels in the aesthetic ability imagine if Joe Biden started dressing and talking like this it would not do wonders for his approval ratings okay maybe it would at first because it would be kind of rad but once the novelty wore off you'd start to question the guy's intentions but even if it doesn't make a lot of sense from an in-universe perspective this design tells you all you need to know about the character from a single glance there is not a speck of good in this man and thus there is not a speck of good in his Empire it is an institution not just corrupt but spiritually evil explicitly allied with metaphysical forces of Darkness remember also that Palpatine isn't named until the prequel trilogy in the original films he's just the Emperor as if he weren't a man at all but a physical manifestation of the concept of tyranny and what this does is Elevate Star Wars as a whole it is in fact even more than a story about Brave rebels fighting an oppressive government the Galactic Civil War is merely a proxy for a far older never-ending battle between the opposed light and dark sides of the force Vader it is dark side worship ceases to be an outsider in the Empire and instead becomes the truest representation of its power because Star Wars isn't science fiction not really it's not about science and technology in the future of man it's about Good and Evil and Corruption and Redemption and Magic it's a fantasy story set in space and usually it hides that fact pretty well but with the character design of Emperor Palpatine it puts it right out in the open the moral is the character design is important and that the emperor is a cool character still dumb that he came back and Rise of Skywalker though see you next time

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",did you guys pick up on the subtle reference to Luke Skywalker Anakin drops drewing his face off with Ahsoka when Ahsoka says I won't fight you Anakin menacingly responds with I've heard that before here I'm pretty sure he's referencing Luke saying this to him in Return of the Jedi during their duel on the second death star I will not fight you father what's crazy about this though is that it's kind of bending the timeline Anakin was Darth Vader when Luke said this line to him and here in Ahsoka even though he's appearing as his younger self this would I guess be a more recent memory for him you are unwise to lower your defenses [Music] 
355,asqzvQEXBIU,2023-09-19T04:03:54Z,"Well, this isn't good",On taika waititi's perhaps cancelled Star Wars project. I can't care anymore lol,well this isn't good the newest rumor is that taika ytt Star Wars movie has been canceled now admittedly this is just a rumor and other sources have said no everything's still fine don't worry about it but the fact that there's still this continued uncertainty over the movie just kind of has me concerned no Star Wars project right now other than TV shows which are actually released has any sort of fan confidence and I mean who could blame fans so many Star Wars projects have been announced then unannounced that it's not even worth talking about it alongside the will it or won't it for the show we also have Lando rumors that that's been transformed to a movie but who knows it could be a movie it could be a show it could be nothing part of the issue really is the writer strike that's obfuscating the true progress that's been made or not made on these projects like one of the rumors about taika's movie is that he's been turning in scripts but the writers strike has just stopped all writing we won't really know until we see a trailer and even then until I've got ass and seat at the movie theater I won't feel confident that any new movie is actually coming out let me know your thoughts below

Towards the end of Obi-Wan Kenobi second episode, Reva (Moses Ingram), an Inquisitor hunting down Jedi, reveals to Obi-Wan that Anakin is still alive after being left to die in the ashes of Mustafar. Now ruling the Empire as Lord Vader, Reva warns Obi-Wan he won’t be able to hide from him forever.

In the closing moments, Obi-Wan is clearly distressed by the news, having assumed he’d died after their duel. “Anakin,” he utters, before it cuts to Anakin in his bacta tank, surrounding by water and apparatus. The episode cuts to black on his breaths; the man he once was is gone, he’s now Darth Vader.",

Volianer",funding for shaperless is provided by squarespace the sponsor of today's video from websites and online stores to marketing tools and analytics squarespace is the all-in-one platform to build a beautiful online presence and run your business a couple of nights ago i decided to watch star wars for no other reason than it being star wars and star wars is awesome usually i don't re-watch movies unless i'm preparing to make a video on them or i'm showing them to someone who hasn't seen them before but that night i just wanted to treat myself star wars is so [ __ ] good man i'll watch it even if that rewatch doesn't contribute to a video with that said watching it gave me an idea for a video see i watched the original theatrical cut from 1977 which i have on dvd in a special 2-pack [ __ ] so i could avoid this mistake among others george lucas really likes to change the original star wars trilogy with each new re-release mostly for the worst by adding terrible cg [ __ ] and unnecessary scenes this is why most star wars fans seek out the original releases of these films even though they're not available anywhere legally besides these sick ass two pack dvds of the original trilogy that came out in like 2006. hey uh disney you guys know you can re-release the original theatrical versions of these films anytime right well like george isn't in charge anymore you can just do it go for it do it anyway i was watching the original theatrical cut as god intended but then we got to the explosion scenes and it hit me just how used to the special edition versions of those scenes i am the explosion rings really add a lot of weight and impact and it's a pretty unintrusive cool change and then i thought about it more and realized hey wait i actually like a few changes they made to these movies there's a lot of improvements here and there that i would legitimately take while leaving others far far behind so i thought it would be fun to do a quick top 10 list of the special edition changes i actually like with the important disclaimer that none of these changes should be allowed to exist without the original versions of these films also being widely available that to me is the main reason why the special editions are so heinous and i wouldn't even mind most of the bad changes if the originals were just easily accessible to re-watch and show people for the first time if we were able to watch the original version of return of the jedi you can just consider the jedi rock scene to be a youtube poop a very very bad youtube poop for the original scene but whatever the changes aren't all bad here's the top 10 ones i like and would not mind being spliced together into versions of these films that keep these things but take out all the bad [ __ ] also i want to reiterate seriously get your hands on these cool ass 2006 dvds if you can not only do they offer the original theatrical releases on disc two but disc one has these super cool menus that actually change every time you insert the dvd like sometimes for empire you're on hoth and there's all these unique menus related to different hoth scenes but you boot it up another time and you're on dagobah which also has its own unique menus and you do that again and you're on cloud city this is the coolest [ __ ] ever and i wish more dvds did this back in the day the prequels also have this feature too and yes i never owned the phantom menace dvd because i hated that movie even as a kid and never asked for it for christmas but yeah these are the dopest menus in existence also the original trilogy ones come with a demo for lego star wars 2. this is the stuff dreams are made of sorry i got very distracted what was the topic of this video again apparently george really [ __ ] up the lightsaber effects in some versions of these movies but one specific part i always appreciated in the special edition version were these two shots in the obi-wan invader duel where the lightsabers just decided to not really work and turn into white sticks usually i don't let outdated effects take me out of a movie and these kinda don't but considering how immersive and impressive the lightsaber effect is 98 of the time seeing vader walk around with a big white stick for a few seconds kinda throws me off a little bit fortunately this is rectified and i feel like if all the special edition changes were like this just simple fixes for actual special effect errors then i doubt anyone would complain about them or maybe there'd still be a crowd of people demanding that disney hashtag release the white stick cut actually this is star wars fans we're talking about so that would 100 happen i don't know what the general consensus is with this change but i personally really like how they removed vader's eyebrows and returned the jedi even ignoring the stronger continuity this makes with revenge of the sith i just never liked how this looked the eyebrows are just so bushy and distracting and taking them out really sells the idea that vader's just this tragic fragile being beneath the mask since this is a really important scene that showcases an entirely new side of vader we've never gotten to see before i think this was a neat worthwhile change but then i guess rebels implied that he did still have eyebrows which i took as confirmation that dave filoni and his team considered the original theatrical releases of the og trilogy to be the canon ones i don't know who cares no eyebrow man looks better moving on [ __ ] you and your eyebrows i'm the wampa i'm the snow man okay so a lot of people seem to have a problem with the cg they added in the wampa scene and i have to agree it does not look at all convincing i mean that's not even luke starkiller anymore that's just purple guy the wampa looks like he was made for the toy story movie this is [ __ ] okay seriously though i like the new wampa scenes they added some people say they take some of the suspense away but i'd argue they add more suspense we've already seen what the wampa looks like so there's no reason to hide it it's actually a lot scarier to show it feasting on the taunton's remains as an indication that oh [ __ ] luke is next plus more blood gore and dismembered limbs is a good thing search your feelings you know it to be true welcome to the himalayas special edition haters i'm really happy for you i'ma let you finish but han chasing down five or six stormtroopers only to be greeted by an entire battalion of them is the funniest [ __ ] i've ever seen the original is fine like it's in character for han to chase five or six guys into a corner and then realize i never thought i'd get this far and then run away but the reveal of there just being a million storm troopers is so [ __ ] funny it makes me want to merge without looking yeah i'm sorry you can call it unnecessary all you want but it still gives me the biggest laugh out of anything in a new hope whether that be from the original cut or the special edition it's so damn good that it was even incorporated into the death star escape level in lego star wars that's how you know you made it big also i'll throw in a little honorable mention here to open the blast doors getting added right before close the blast doors that's comedy gold right there okay i'm gonna be totally honest with you guys the jedi rocks dance number in my humble opinion is without a doubt the cringiest [ __ ] in any star wars movie aside from the entirety of ryze skywalker i hate it so much but the scene right after with jabba's slave girl oola was actually pretty good in the original he sends her down a pit it burns but it doesn't really mean anything or leave any impact he just has a hole in his floor and something bad happens down there i don't know but in 1997 they filmed a new scene where she actually goes into the rancor pit and we gotta tease that something's down there which heightens the tension when luke is negotiating with jabba and standing on that trap door miraculously the actress looks the exact same 14 years later and it's all just generally very seamless it actually enhances the storytelling by setting the rancor up earlier without revealing what it looks like good job jabba this almost makes me forgive you for the cgi cringe fest i just witnessed except no no it doesn't at all okay now this change was actually really cool and no one talks about it so in return of the jedi they added new dialogue to that one conversation vader and the emperor have on the death star palpy says soon the rebellion will be crashed and young skywalker will be one of us and then vader's like yes my master but what do you plan on doing afterwards i don't know i never thought i'd get this far perhaps i shall take up knitting and create a new line of wool stormtroopers that i can sell for profit but how will you create a website to promote your new business master it is simple lord vader i will use square space once more square space shall have a sponsored ad and we shall have pretty bitchin websites wait i'm confused what is squarespace exactly oh hold on i think i have an ad for it somewhere

you're ready to launch go to squarespace.com jay furless to save 10 off your first purchase of a website or domain so that theme was really good but also i didn't put it on the ranking list because i for gore whoops oh well back to the list yep the impetus for this entire video existing these explosion rings are so cool man i always picture them whenever i think of either death star or alderaan exploding the coolest one has got to be death star 2. the way it follows the falcon is just chef's kiss so visually satisfying the fact that the death star 1 has a vertical ring is maybe a little strange but whatever i guess it's less visually repetitive that way yeah i don't know what else do you want me to say for these it's just a cool new effect that really sells some of the most important moments in the series it's epic moving on i had a really tough time deciding where to put return of the jedi's ending as well as which elements of it to include i hate hayden showing up as much as the next guy so [ __ ] that i like all the planets celebrating that's a fantastic idea but that weissa free [ __ ] really rubs me the wrong way so at the end of the day the only change i'm going to officially put in this spot is changing the music from yubnub to something actually good okay i'm just meaning i like yubnub it's a cute fun song but is this any way to end a series like damn [ __ ] we lived like this the new song is gorgeous and a perfect note to go out on if there was a version of the scene that kept the new song but returns to the original anakin ghost i'd be all for it make it happen editors send it to me on twitter oh by the way i have a twitter i always seem to get an influx of new followers every time i mention my twitter in a video since i guess most people aren't aware that i have one so i have a twitter do your thing and i'm happy now this is just really sweet and sad and i can't imagine being upset with this change and i also can't imagine why it wasn't in the original and i also can't imagine why it wasn't in the original cut of the film biggs is still mentioned in a new hope and he shows up flying an x-wing at the end before getting killed having this scene before the battle of yavin where luke and biggs get to reunite and briefly reminisce is just really heartwarming it's a great payoff to when luke talked about him earlier in the film and it gives his death actual emotional weight it's not a pace breaker it only lasts like 30 seconds why did george initially cut this oh well i'm just really glad he put it back dylan you son of a [ __ ] i probably ranked this higher than i should have since it's just an aesthetic change but i honestly cannot get over how gorgeous the cloud city vistas are in the special edition they are just so aesthetically pleasing and they make this feel like more of a world rather than a set the beautiful skyline is a great juxtaposition to the tense chastion set in the city and they're so much more atmospheric than white hallways when i think of cloud city i always think of the special edition shots they really add so much more to the film than you'd expect it's also nice to get shots of the people reacting to lando's psa and seeing that this broadcast is city wide and also i'd like to award bonus points to george for not removing the guy who's just carrying an ice cream maker this guy is an integral part of star wars and i'm glad george wasn't too irrationally embarrassed to the point where he cut him out i cannot wait for ice cream man a star wars story coming to disney plus to today it's launching today congratulations yeah ice cream okay real quick some honorable mentions the original cut of empire had some weird transitions in terms of the score where the screen would wipe and one song would abruptly stop in order to get replaced with a different song it's nice that the special edition fix this boba fett's voice change is somewhat controversial i think it's pretty raw that the original actor has essentially been removed from star wars but it's still a good bit of continuity to add in the jango fett actor especially now thanks to the mandalorian really solidifying this guy as boba fett ultimately i'm torn i don't really have a preference in terms of the line deliveries and i can see both sides of the argument i don't know it's not the worst change the original effect of luke falling from the cloud city shaft and empire looks really shitty to the point where it kinda took me out of the dramatic scene a little bit so i was tempted to include the improved version on this list but in 1997 lucas decided to add the emperor's screen to this scene [Music] what he took it out in later versions but the fact that it was ever included at all makes me want to leave this entire scene off the best changes list as punishment also let's talk about yoda and the phantom menace because george actually went back to this movie and took out puppet yoda in favor of cg yoda while it's now way more visually cohesive with the other two prequels it's just so off because frank oz delivered his lines in a very similar manner to the original trilogy yoda probably because he was still working with a puppet in phantom menace so yoda's voice in this movie is still very upbeat and fast which is fine but then you put on attack of the clones and he's slow as [ __ ] the dark side clouds everything the cg yoda in phantom menace doesn't feel right because he doesn't talk the same way he does in clones and sith he talks super fast and more jovially but at the end of the day i don't have to look at that weirdly shitty phantom menace puppet anymore so i guess it's a good change and i know i'm really delaying the number one here but i have to talk about my dishonorable mention it's not the worst change not by a long shot but it is my personal least favorite and no one ever talks about it in the original cut of empire after vader tries to convince luke to join him and utterly fails the next time we see him he just says this to his troops bring my shuttle very blunt very curt he's not in the mood for his usual verbose language he's [ __ ] pissed and you can hear it in his voice so then george changed it for no reason and just made it any old line now he's just telling them to alert his star destroyer to prepare for his arrival this man just watched his son attempt to kill himself rather than join him this is not how he would act obviously the no scream and return the jedi is worse but this scene also just represents a fundamental misunderstanding of vader's character and i hate it more because of how invested i was in that original line and how james earl jones delivered it whatever [ __ ] it i guess it doesn't matter here's my number one yeah you knew this one was coming the old emperor sucks it's some lady in makeup that they superimposed chimp eyes onto the voice actor honestly sounds bored we're supposed to believe this guy is above darth vader but james earl jones is running circles around this guy's delivery both in terms of intimidation and actual acting i'd like to believe that if i saw this movie for the first time in 1980 without knowing anything about ian mcdermott's portrayal of the emperor i still wouldn't be impressed i'm sorry i know this weird off-brand [ __ ] dr bob-ass version of palpatine has its fans but i'm not one of them and even if you like this portrayal of palpatine i have no idea how you would ever justify keeping it in over the ian mcdermott version it just doesn't make sense continuity wise to have this abomination in favor of the real emperor who was established as such later on in this trilogy it's not like this is a fairly unnecessary prequels deep cut like boba fett's voices this is just a matter of bringing this movie in line with its direct sequel and the iconic portrayal of this character that star wars fans universally love the special edition emperor or should i say the actual emperor or should i call him darth sidious is oozing with evilness if you're watching these movies in release order and this is your first exposure to palpatine you immediately get why this guy is above vader and yeah they slightly alter the dialogue since now vader asks how it's possible that luke is the offspring of anakin i mean hey it's in line with revenge of the sith's events and it's easy to assume that vader is lying to palpatine here he knows palpatine was lying about padme's death he literally tells luke in this movie that they can overthrow palpatine he actively knows that palpatine's a lying piece of [ __ ] at this point and he's just feigning ignorance about luke's origins in this scene the sith are all about lies deception and betrayal and so none of the dialogue changes in the scene are a problem they all make sense i don't want to hear any arguments with this change in particular if you're showing someone the original versions of these films as their first exposure to star wars pause empire when you get to this scene boot up disney plus show them the new version and then continue on with the original actually now that i think about it you could probably just get away with showing them the special edition of empire it really doesn't have any problems outside of that one bring my shuttle line that i'm still mad about but yeah that's all the special edition changes i really like and even love in some cases i really wish there was a convenient way that i could pick and choose the changes that i would keep while preserving the original versions of other scenes that got completely bastardized by special edition changes oh well the moral of the story is that sometimes fixing things is good parts of the special editions are really sexy and i'm tired of pretending they're not but it really doesn't matter because the original versions of these films still aren't widely available which makes these new versions a load of banta poo doo why would you go through the trouble of adding the javascreen back in when they literally repeat the same lines verbatim from the greedo scene why is the cgi incomprehensibly bad why does boba fett look at the god damn camera why is greedo wandering around in the background when he just got shot you can't make this [ __ ] up and do i even need to talk about greedo and that load of mcclunky that is his scene disney i am begging you please re-release the good version of a new hope the one that isn't even called a new hope because that title is stupid it's star wars star wars is star wars star wars is star wars good night tri-state galaxy [Music] [Applause] you

This is a meme about space theory.,hello internet welcome to space theory in today's episode i wanted to analyze the realism of the head game among us among us actually takes place in space in the game you do a bunch of tasks similar to something you would see in a real-life space mission however i did find one in consistency you see the game requires you to spend all this time discovering dead bodies but you should actually be discovering some unfortunately if you could not get any  on earth what makes you think you can get any in space not only that but i also noticed your reddit and discord accounts were very active as expected this scared all the alien  away it is also mandatory to take showers every day in space which is clearly impossible for you but if you were expecting to maybe find your dad in space after an extensive search i actually found your dad however when i told him you were with me he said that he would be traveling back to her just so he could abandon you again you know what this means right you're both bitchless and still fatherless therefore we can conclude that there is not a single plane in our galaxy where you get any but hey that's just a theory a space theory

This video was made to go a long side a *Twitter thread* that I made for my friends to document some of GameTheory's mistakes. This video was NOT made to criticize Mathew as a person, or hurt his reputation, but reflect on *his lack of accountability* for mistakes. Time and Time again MatPat has disappointed his fans. If I could redo this video I would, I would focus on him lying about someone's suicide and how he refuses to apologize for donating to anti-autistic charity organizations. 

I was simply calling him hypercritical for claiming he cares but being unable to listen or even *apologize*. I plan on making an actual indepth video about all of this.


do NOT go and harass MatPat, or anyone in the comments, I do not condone attacking him. This is not me trying to cancel him, THIS WILL NOT AFFECT MATPAT AT ALL. If you think this video will stain his ""good image"" you are very wrong. I don't think he will care nor will any of his loyal fans care either.",but we're unmasking this masked thing oh and by that same logic Ash Ketchum Bart Simpson Gohan and Popeye would all be girls and while I do question Ash's inability to close the deal with Misty and the painstaking hairstyles of Barton Gohan Popeye come on it's Popeye the only thing manlier would be a fighter jet made out of biceps if the Pyro wants to carry around a bedazzled Daisy clutch that's the Pyro's choice but the second our favorite flame spewing shell admits to knowing it's called a clutch then we can start to draw conclusion wait let me guess you just stopped to check your hands didn't you loyal theorists if you need to check your fingers to tell me what team you're batting for my friend you have much bigger issues to Grapple with than the pyros sex but if I can help you on your quest for self-discovery I gladly accept the task there were some findings that I think that science will be very interesting to explore further like the fact that apparently there are over 600 different genders you know I've always taken Pride knowing that we have a diverse audience watching but I never in my wildest dreams imagined it was so diverse to include people who self-identify as everything from a 1960s era Coca-Cola bottle to a weaponized battle poster I've heard that gender is a spectrum and all that but can someone explain to me whether gay jalapeno is to the left or right of literal piece of human fecal matter oh and uh by the way to the 1610 of you who responded with Apache attack helicopter thank you so much for raising awareness for the oft overlooked hellisexuals and even if you don't believe me I think that there's one thing we can all agree on gay or not the Pyro is one big flamer but hey that's just a theory a game theory clearly I respect the community so much that I left the field completely open because I wanted everyone to be able to express themselves exactly as they identify the responses I cited were intended as jokes by the people who entered them Point your Witch Hunt somewhere else April 14th 2018 March 18 2018. if you make a mistake say I'm sorry lately it seems like people are afraid to apologize they see it as admitting weakness but saying I'm sorry shows you're confident enough to admit you're not perfect that you care about others and that your

Might not be literally every time he's said those words anywhere, but at least every time he ends a main channel video with the catchphrase.
In case anyone wonders, this is a total of 377 video outros synced up. A surprising bit lower than the total videos on the channel (currently total 643, so about 58.6 %), but quite many had wording variations, were narrated by other hosts with other outros, or otherwise lacked the exact catchphrase.

I don't even watch this guy that much... this was just goofy shitpost project that I wanted to make for no good reason. And I genuinely had to wait until I upgraded my PC to make it – turns playing hundreds of videos at once requires powerful hardware. (It still bluscreened several times while exporting.)

I uploaded this in 8K 60fps preserve all the glorious theorizing quality (each original are 1080p 60fps), but somehow it took YouTube several weeks to make that resolution available. Oh well.",

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",low Snips have you ever wondered why Anakin calls Soaker Snips it's actually a call back to the Clone Wars movie from 2008 and it actually comes right after Ahsoka calls Anakin Sky guy for the first time you're stuck with me Sky guy what did you just call me don't get snippy with me little one from this point forward because Ahsoka was snippy with Anakin he decided to call her Snips as their relationship developed don't get much closer Sky guy I knew you'd get here sniffs eventually always in time to save your life 
368,HD5k6goPWVI,2023-09-11T01:38:34Z,Ahsoka is simply built different,"Episode Four of Ahsoka has been extremely successful, so much so. That it's drawing the attention of people outside of the Star Wars sphere...

#Disney #Ahsoka #StarWars",Ahsoka is just completely dominating not just the Star Wars realm of media but also publicists and media critics right now this is because Rotten Tomato critics gave the episode a perfect 100 across 20 different reviewers and a 9 out of 10 on IMDb by over 8 000 user ratings but not everyone is convinced IGN is getting a lot of heat over their review of the episode which was a bland six out of 10 with their biggest criticisms being the continued stiff performance of Ahsoka by Rosaria Dawson and the flat cliche dialogue fans General reception however is extremely positive mostly towards the lightsaber fights the fact that Marek wasn't another well-known cameo in Disguise which Dave filoni is known to do the reveal of Anakin Skywalker and the world Between Worlds but most of all baleen the new dark Jedi character by Ray Stevenson with some fans saying he could have been the next perfect big bad villain of Star Wars up there with the likes of Darth Vader so things are looking very good for Ahsoka with Disney revealing the extremely high viewership of episode 1 a few weeks ago and fans roaring with praise for the recent episodes so it feels like Disney is slowly gaining back the respect of fans but what do you think let me know in the comments down below or for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

These aren't the links you're looking for - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSaasl-nseo",hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to part three of a critique of Star Wars the last Jedi this is the final part in the series oh and as you guys may know this part was delayed because I have several added bits and bobs from comments as well as answering a few things here and there to really make this series complete for example the word decimates has a primary definition and that is to kill destroy or remove a large portion of it then also has an outdated historic usage where you essentially kill 1 out of 10 men in a group to try and quell a mutiny or somesuch which considering this film is an interesting connection I suppose anyway I think you get the point for all the commenters who parroted that I am NOT allowed to use that word don't worry I'm gonna use loads of synonyms this time around something I would like to open with quick is that I didn't mention how Luke said Snoke got to him first in reference to kylos downfall this detail is important as it would appear that Kyla was taken rather than lost which makes Luke's abandonment all the more difficult to accept but I mean he can't really do anything at this point that we won't be surprised at because we don't have anything to work from anymore right he's just a completely new character and some people misunderstood the issue the whole everyone has the force thing I'm absolutely okay with any individual training and becoming a wielder of force powers I am certain that anyone can but when you jump to unlimited power immediately with no training or understanding of the force it is incredibly frustrating as you are screwing with universal rules Hey Yoda 800 years of mastery who cares apparently Rey was born with it hey Palpatine you've been building an empire and power for decades you should have hired Rey to do it for you hey Vader most powerful force user no no no no no here comes ray failure is the best teacher right the motif of the film well Rey dominates with or without this theme and it's hard to swallow because if you're telling me that Rey like people are gonna start popping up everywhere then that's a really sad reality about how the force now works something I missed was that if the codebreaker asked the first-order for a ship and resources in exchange for information then why wouldn't they simply torture it out of him they're shown to be incredibly militaristic and damning of the opponents regardless of morality they do not tend to be even remotely fair but they are here for some reason I suppose it was for the realization that the codebreaker betrayed Finn and rose like it makes for a much more interesting story that he would sell them out as opposed to we just find out he's dead and they have the information cuz that sounds as though he was tortured to death which is just a horrible ending for his character versus he was a traitor remember it was nicely shot with him coming in from the side even though they've been in that room for a decent chunk of time and they should probably have seen him already but you know never mind also I missed something in this scene phasma says she wants to kill them in a manner that makes it hurt and she opts for decapitation why bother with an instant kill method if the goal was to make it hurt versus a blaster shot a blaster shot to the legs for example would hit a large amount more than the decapitation would as you would be alive for the duration oh wait don't you guys see Captain phasma is stupid that explains that also many people are angry that I hadn't included the line from the resistance that they wanted to divert their shields to the engines and that explains the bridge and the hangar being blown away by kylo I'm sorry I didn't take this argument seriously but for those people who do let me debunk it as bad writing for you in the history of space battles the best you get his shields being blasted down over time [Music] a ship like the Radice is enormous and canonically had extremely powerful shields yet when the bad guys show up literally the beginning of the battle Ryan needed the bridge to be blown out despite the shield's being at maximum otherwise Leia would not have her seen but he also needed to do this without affecting the ship much at all so how do you go about doing something like that well he has a throwaway line to say that they are diverting the shield's to the engines this means that every other area of the ship is now open to attack that's ridiculous as a decision when enemy fighters have been scrambled on top of the fact that the shields should be more than capable of surviving the blasts at least for a little bit as that is their purpose this plan to focus the shields on the engines at the cost of your own hangar bay bridge and well the entire ship is akin to your house being assaulted by thugs and so you rip off the front door of your house in order to staple it to the back door ultimately even if you are focusing shields on another part of the ship then why would you not focus it on the bridge as well since that contains every resistance leader it doesn't make sense and I didn't talk about it because I thought it was nonsense but you're right I should have kept it in though as I said it was really hard to get everything in and this little intro I mean this will give you some evidence of that because since we're on that note how is it that the raddest is moving at a faster speed than the maximum speed of a Star Destroyer yet when Leia gets blown out into space and has a decent chunk of time just floating around how is it that she manages to just float right back in how isn't it that the ship had blasted far away from her at that point it is moving at a very high speed why was it stationary when she wanted to get back in this doesn't make any sense though honestly I've had so many insightful comments and I kind of want to parrots some of them here in case some of you don't know about these extra plot holes it is established that the Millennium Falcon can actually get in and out of this chase through space if you will in order to drop off and pick up ray now we know the Millennium Falcon is actually pretty big and you can fit a lot of people in it there is only what 400 people in the Radice so why not ferry them out with the Millennium Falcon you could save a hell our lives in fact you could save all of them though this just compounds the horrible horrible plot hole that if chewy can close gaps with hyperspace to get to the Radice then why can't the first order do that speaking of hyperspace and how this film has decided to portray its power why is it that the resistance can't simply have the ships that are about to run out of fuel or fall behind toon and use their hyperdrive on the first order this is a maneuver that they're fully aware of and it may or may not deal significant damage whether or not it does it's a definitively better shot than doing nothing and just getting blown up makes no sense additionally when we begin the film the ship itself has a goal of finding a new base fair enough they end up just talking about it then they are attacked and so hold o devices the plan to go to crate why weren't they heading to crate in the first place that sounds like a perfect new place for a base there's already a fortress there why didn't they hyperspace right - it makes no sense there was something I wanted to clarify and it was in the part 1 I said that the magnetized bombs was actually a pretty good argument now my mistake there was actually referring to it as magnetized bombs when in reality I really just want to talk about magnets I think that there is a scientist out there that could make it work with magnets my idea as a layman was that you would magnetize the rails and you would propel the bombs out and the momentum would carry them to the ship below because if the bombs themselves were magnetized and yes it would cause conflicts so I understand why people got a bit confused and that's just bad wording buy my part anyway I actually did miss that Huck's found the rebel base in the force awakens and that explains how they know where the planet is at the beginning of the last Jedi we have their location we tracked their reconnaissance ship to the ileenium system but honestly my problem is more to do with how it was all rushed we don't know for sure that they are the same planets maybe a visual novel explains that also I thought that the resistance knew that the first order knew where their planet was at the end of force awakens because that's exactly what the star killer was about to fire out near the end of the film remember that the main point is the film just hard opens - episode 5 instead of building it and it fits in with the movies obsession with action-packed emotional scenes before building them or developing any characters that's what I tried to get across about the pieces of the board analogy though I really did make genuine mistakes already any other videos I didn't realize that c-3po gains and drops the red arm in force awakens so the criticism about sales is fair but it's not attributed to Rian Johnson in terms of forgetting it sorry Ryan not everything is your fault dude also everyone is telling me the chorus --nt was not blown up and it was in fact hosnian prime you would not know this from the movie as hosnian prime is not a label used in the film they only refer to the system it belonged to once I'm sorry finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the hosnian system he worked on the base we're desperate for anything you can tell for all any viewers could know Carson could actually be in the hose nian system since that is meaningless to us as information and the mere fact they look so similar is almost an attempt to make people think it is car isn't it's almost like the wheel building is just horrible on the hyperspace point by the way people have said that you could just make hyperspace missiles could you imagine that a missile with the capabilities of nuking the Death Star the Death Star was built by the finest military mind for weaponry after decades Aeryn inspires artists but you're terrible and yet it could be thwarted by tech that apparently existed this whole time at least according to the new lead writers remember these are the same writers who said that the hyperspace move didn't change the law whatsoever also I forgot to cover that the actual mask of Vader's just like Anakin's lightsaber is not given any kind of origin like how could kylo possibly have this and how did Mars get the lightsaber or did you get that a good question for another time the Vedas mask is literally dropped from the film we can assume that kylo has gotten over his Vader obsession and wants to strike out on his own but we don't get a scene where he reconciles the time he spent communing with Vader assuming that's even what it was was he simply communing with Snoke and it was a trick who knows we all have to write this for Ryan because he didn't put it into the film anyway following from the previous video a detail I want covered as I somehow missed it is that Anakin's lightsaber was torn in half when kylo and Rey tried to force it off each other Rey kept both pieces of it and escaped just something that I needed to actually be said because it's gonna come up later it also functions as a metaphor of what the original and the prequels mean to this film I suppose but that's that subjective folks you you can make of that what you will finally I want to comment on the whole force creating balance thing in George Lucas's eyes balance meant the destruction of the Sith but now it means that there always has to be a power that counterbalances its opposition strong light means there needs to be strong dark strong dark means there needs to be strong light this would be something they really don't want you to think about you know does a new light side peers and just spawn the moment the dark side person kills the current like person are you telling me that it took the force 30 years to have Luke rise to oppose Vader but it also happened to require training and years to complete from the outset of him even knowing that he could be a Jedi Knight because that's similar to Rey isn't it are you saying people as powerful as Rey pop up whenever someone like ray dies and the same for kylo like there is a slot to be filled this is literally the same premise as buffy the vampire Slayer's source of power now and if you're really going to make this much of a big deal about the force attempting to balance out the light in the dark if Rey and kylo balance each other out then who balances for Snoke he is clearly not neutral and who was the balance for Palpatine in the OT unfortunately it doesn't stop there in the first six episodes it is heavily implied that the dark side was the quick and easy route to power and the light was something you had to train for work for and discipline for but when we really think about what is happening in these movies kylo has trained for years with two extremely potent teachers and yet he is still trying to find his potential despite being on the dark side we then have Ray who was basically done nothing to receive massive amounts of power from the light side she has not to work for anything or focus or train and yet she is equal if not more potent than kylo it's as if they've now flip the script and torn away the meaning of the light and dark sides as paths one can choose and of course Rey does all of this without a single hardship I mean even Anakin despite being the chosen one falling to the dark side failed again and again and again there is no respect for the source material attempts to recontextualize the OT in prequels once again forces the film to fall flat on its face as it embarrasses itself trying to say that it knows what it was truly happening in those films when they were self contained just fine one of my favorite comments from the previous video however was a user named in DES own and they pointed out something extremely fundamental about the storytelling of Episode seven to eight Rey was very much concerned for her potential family and the realization she's provided is quite heartbreaking for whoever you're waiting for on jakku they're never coming back her parents are never coming back they aren't relevant to her she needs to look to the future now not the past the belonging you seek is not behind you it is ahead so why is it that Rey feels as though she has been retconned in Episode eight she is massively concerned with her parentage even though in Episode seven she came to terms of the fact that she won't be seeing her parents again and so there is a thought the dialogue well the script in general is constructed in this film as though Ryan is writing as a direct response to the fans and in spite of them as if the characters behave based on the meta surrounding the movie Ray wasn't concerned with her parentage by the end of Episode seven the fan base was the fan base was obsessed with it as a plot point to explain her power and so it became a plot point in Episode eight I'm gonna point out patterns later in this video this is one that I won't be covering because I'm just gonna say it now Ryan has created a script that doesn't focus on what the characters want in terms of answers and motivations but what the fans want in terms of answers and motivations let me provide an additional example kylo kills his father Han Solo at what is essentially an attempt to gain the appeasement of smoke and Snoke decides that kylo still has some training to do despite that so he wants him to kill snoke decided the killing Han Solo hero to the rebel forces kylos father of decades didn't really prove anything Snoke decided the killing Rey kylos weird friend of one day will complete his Darkseid training Snoke shouldn't think that kylo even gives the tiniest of care for Rey compared to Han considering everything we know this is so weird the last test or training for the dark side is to kill a girl with no ability to fight while your master holds them down that is so pathetic for the dark side why not have him fight Rey to the death why should kylo killing Rey matter to Snoke anyway because I can tell you who it actually matters to rather than Snoke it's the fans on the fan fiction writer the script is focusing on what the fans think should matter rather than what genuinely happens in this story the characters actually seem to care about the meta not only is this a bad focus in terms of trying to write your characters but Ryan does indeed decide to do nothing with these things as well but yes no way through that let's get on with the plot now like I said everyone's heading to crate so we cut to the planet crate apparently every transport ship is landed and the resistance has prepared a full defense of the area this happens immediately there are no establishing scenes for it as I said in the last part this ending is incredibly rushed it simply begins with Leia saying the first order is coming it is as though we have just started a new film entirely in fact it is a clone of episode 5 again remember episode 5 guys the setup that is once again not earned at all is the resistance it's at about 100 or less people they are holed up in an old rebel fortress and the first order is about to assault it with a series of walkers at present the resistance is trying to close the doors because they hadn't done that already despite being chased ferociously by the first order and a singular enemy ship manages to make it through despite many of them trying the resistance including general Leia herself actually opened fire on this singular ship with their blasters this is such a tiny yet hilarious moment there are no enemy soldiers as they would be exiting through a little ramp if they were actually there and the to fire cannot melt steel transports so what do they hope to achieve here they're just splashing the ship with blaster shots for absolutely no reason is it to make the audience feel as though something is happening neither PO nor Leia would ever do this it doesn't make sense they would wait to see what happens if they saw stormtroopers come out of the ship they would then open fire we then see hands pop up from the ship itself we discover that it is in fact fin rose and bb-8 it was the ship they boarded and left on just after killing phasma and they were the only ones to make it into this base alive from the first order fleet you see writing is wonderful when you can be this convenient now all of our heroes are in the exact same place and prepared for a hostile battle on crate well no they haven't explained that Rey is here yet I'm sure she's somewhere else because she's not gonna conveniently end up here as well right anyway post says that their shields are up so they cannot be bombarded from orbit that is obviously setting up the assault from the ground which begins just a moment after he mentions it with the sounds of crafts dropping to the surface this is just another example of a throwaway line explaining a potential plot hole why wouldn't the first-order nuke the planet with assault cannons because they have shields up this is fine by the way I'm absolutely okay with it is simply a strong highlight that Rian Johnson knows how to use exposition unfortunately when it comes to many other aspects of the story he simply forgets to use it the first order within seconds of seeing the planet have dropped an army of walkers and a cannon the gorilla walkers are essentially just a t-80s and that's fine in terms of design it just seems lucky and convenient that they not only have these on board the supremacy but that they drop them so insanely fast with no connecting scenes to explain it this may not have been an issue except for the fact that we have a fleet of stardestroyers that have been obliterated and the supremacy is in two pieces looks like we have yet another gap in the plot and that's quite a major one also we have the same poaching problem here in Episode five the Empire knew they were heading to Hoth and the walkers were perfect for the terrain here though they just have them like is that gorilla Walker just standard does it have anything to do with the difficult terrain because this planet's terrain is actually a clean sheet it's not even cold but we'll get to that finn comments on the cannon saying it's a miniaturized Death Star tech and it'll crack the door open like egg the door that no other weaponry can apparently crack firstly what a coincidence that they have this weapon it's perfect for the situation this also raises an important question why Ryan is this kind of tech not on the first orders starships especially if it's the most powerful weapon they have Ryan please the characters that decide if they're going to utilize fight or flight bb-8 that immediately enters the scene and c-3po translates the droid apparently bb-8 has analyzed the schematic for the entire mine and there is only one way in or out through the door so they have no choice but to stop the cannon finn then makes a small speech about saving the resistance and biding time until help comes as the help will eventually come since people believe in Leia I think this is definitive evidence that the speech the Code Breaker gave finn about morality meant nothing really finn is not going to grow from it in any way he's not skeptical of the resistance or the cause in fact he seems to feel the opposite to that despite being explained that there's bad on both sides which means the theme of morality that was explored through the idea of a war machine truly was for the audience a cheap few minutes to throw it out and move right along so the people could write essays about the depth that that very concept offers there are some crystal foxes by the way they don't really do anything but they look pretty I suppose obviously they will make extremely cool toys to the shot then turns to Rose and shows his smiling which is obviously a character moment for Finn he is fighting the enemy head-on now instead of running but I'm not clear on what experience brought him here learning about moral ambiguity doesn't equal bravery in the face of death learning about defenseless animals slave children and evil rich people thanks to arm sales doesn't equal bravery in the face of death being betrayed by a mercenary doesn't exactly mean bravery in the face of death performing one of the most dangerous espionage missions ever seen in the saga in aid of the resistance is bravery meaning that from roses perspective this doesn't make any sense he never lacked any bravery nor did it get reinvigorated so this isn't an arc this is just finding two rows that apparently is not a coward which was something she should have figured out already but why would it be something we care about we barely know why these two even connect what we should have seen was Finn realizing what happens when people don't fight and why fighting is important if anything the scenes in canto bite about the war machine should have convinced him to run from the organizations that blow each other up this arc of Finn's is simple he wants to run and then he doesn't run it's just like the force awakens I think I see where they were going with it to basically make him disenfranchised from the first order only to basically flip the coin and then be fully indoctrinated by the resistance but the building blocks are either out of place or irrespective of each other since he was weaselly in his opening scenes but that's dropped the moment he goes on a secret mission that is incredibly dangerous they have rows remind us that Finn is cowardly but we know better than to believe that we know his character better than she does so it just feels off we then cut to the resistance preparing an identical defensive crate as the rebels did for half in episode 5 and since we are so close to direct plagiarism they have a character taste the ground and declare that we aren't on a snow planet it's a salt planet if this was in any other movie it would be massively criticized by everybody but because it's in a Star Wars film nearly 40 years later it is considered an endearing and referential moment in a skilled or clever way rather than the ideas of a hack also a salt planet seriously this reminds me of a child saying something like there's this planet it's made of jelly and this one it's made of cheese lava ice tropics forest desert rain and ocean planets are elemental salt is just salt please try and be a little bit more creative not to mention that some guy deciding to taste the ground is so strange like you end up on this new and amazing planet so you turn to your fellow soldier and say hey Steve mine taste in the ground to see what will we load it into we then see that Finn Rose and Poe with a handful of random resistance members are making their way towards the walkers in these strange new ships Finn is somehow piloting one of them despite the previous film making it clear that he cannot pilot a ship but since I pointed that out in part 1 all I can really say is we must assume he learned how to pilot while being in a coma continuity used to be a thing anyway we have to ask ourselves why are the writers forcing Finn to be in this situation the reason this is happening is that Finn is supposed to have an important moment soon and so we need to forget about his inability to pilot that's only gonna get in the way and we of course know that the best stories ignore rules for emotional scenes that's what good writing is correct Huck's then says there are a total of 13 speeders and Kaila demands that they push right through them to the wall these speeders have very little defense and are limited in terms of offenses as a result they begin to be picked off by the first order with ease I like many at this point was wondering just what the point of all of this was what is the plan here you can't possibly hope to take down an 80 80 let alone these new models by crashing a speeder into it that would mean you're dead anyway so what is happening here Poe says how long we got to hold them till they pull up that cannon in a sort of sarcastic and frustrated way so I guess the speeders are meant to distract the guerrillas until they pull up the cannon since the speeders don't actually damage anything so why not wait to release the speeders once the cannon is actually on its way since now you're just driving in circles waiting for the cannon to come towards you while getting sniped by the walkers and the TIE fighters like this scene gets really stupid when you realize that they've sent all of these speeders out to simply die unless the cannon actually shows up in time all the first-order has to do now is stop pulling the cannon then they can destroy the speeders in terms of however long that takes then continue pulling the cannon and continue firing this scene makes no sense we then see roses in imminent danger and moments before she is killed by three tie fighters the Millennium Falcon saves her life it is driven by Chewbacca while he is playing with the pork's and the gunner is none other than Rey herself who has successfully left snoke's ship made it back to Chewie and is saving the lives of the rest of the heroes again this without a single scene to establish it she's just here now get over it this moment is almost exactly the same as a new hope do you remember when three ships were chasing Luke only in a new hope we had Han Solo a selfish scoundrel whose roguish charm won over the people that he would eventually consider abandoning but after seeing the plight of the people he'd suffered with as well as the cause he had come to understand he pulled through and saved the life of the man who went on to destroy the most powerful galaxies gripping weapon the Empire had one of the most classic arcs used to explain how characters learn and grow on screen while here we have Rey saving them because that's all Rey does she's perfect and she's doing it because it was in a new hope not to mention that Rey has never used the gunner before or certainly not the Millennium Falcon gunner and on her very first shot from the gunner on the ship itself she gets a triple kill three Thai fighters in one shot she is better at this than any pilot we have seen previously despite having absolutely no experience no she's not a Mary Sue that's ridiculous she also tells Chewie exactly what to do and where to go throughout the scene as well she criticizes him for not driving well enough at one point in the caverns because again she is poached his piloting abilities and piloting knowledge for herself despite his decades of history with the ship then despite the established rule set of these speeders kylo and Huck's command every single toy fighter to pursue the Millennium Falcon and since that ship is literally immune to destruction they all perish while trying to shoot at it this is so monumentally stupid and convenient that it makes complete sense that it takes place in this film the cabin they go through to escape the TIE fighters is obviously a retread of the Death Star run in Episode six by the way I wanted to point that out in case these Steel's I mean references weren't clear for you anyway back to the actual battleground where kylo has forgotten something may I remind you the only threat to the cannon is one of those ships shooting it or ploughing directly into it and instead of making sure that each of the thirteen are destroyed before reaching the cannon kylo sends his forces away this makes no sense but it allows the next scene to take place so it's great the only argument I've heard about this is that kylo hates the Millennium Falcon to the point where he forgets anything is happening around him and demands its destruction the way it goes is that kylo is such an angsty angry psycho that he makes bad decisions that are focused on the destruction of his enemies but that doesn't actually explain this scene if kyla was hell-bent on destroying what remains of his enemies then he should be focusing entirely on the cannon it is the key to ending the resistance by sending every fighter to the Falcon which just so happens to be viii when it should be hundreds of thousands kylo is ruining his own chances of completing the only goal he has ultimately this wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that these guerrilla Walker's have decided to stop shooting re-watch this film pay attention to this scene they no longer shoot they just stopped you should also realize that something is very wrong when you're only defensive a terrible plot rescuing action is that a character is being stupid like I said in the previous parts this is akin to having a child or someone who's mentally deficient and that's a cop-out to have a scene that you want not to mention by the way that Kyla went from saying that everything needs to end there needs to be a new power a new faction and that he and Ray could lead it to just being the replacement for Snoke so now we have Ryan ruining the characters George and his team created in the OT then we have him ruining what characters JJ created in the force awakens and now he is actively ruining his own work did you believe me when I said this script was hemorrhaging then we have some clunky exposition Poe says she drew off all of them and Finn shouts whoa they hate that ship these are extremely cartoonish lines spoken as if the writer is saying to the audience look now they're safe and it makes sense okay it does stop asking questions Kyla doesn't like the Millennium Falcon neither does hugs so they're ridiculously stupid decisions make sense okay that is a okay Ryan I totally believe the scene Thank You Finn then says that the cannon is charging and the only chance is to go right down its throat like Independence Day and so the tension Rises because the characters remembered that they have an army of 80 80s standing there in the battlefield remember I comment about this well they start shooting again now this whole time they've just been sitting there but thank God some of the writers actually remember they exist is it worth even saying the word continuity anymore the resistance then loses every single ship except the ones piloted by Poe Finn and Rose do I need to say the phrase plot armor probably not Poe upon seeing several of his comrades die decides that the mission is already lost the cannon is charged and the only result is a suicide run this is considered an arc by many people however once again like Finn it does not add up Poe saw that the girl in the original fight in the film died in order to destroy the Dreadnought and thus save lives Poe considered this a worthy sack as it turned out it was more than just that because of the tracker that the first order had in place his decision to push the destruction of the super weapon proved to be the right choice then as it was in the force awakens there is nothing to learn from those experiences all that happened was two of his superiors told him he is reckless despite saving everyone's lives twice now he's faced with that same choice again and he's backing out this cannon will end the resistance and you want to pull out to save a member of the resistance you learn this lesson by being lied to and abused by your commanders for not blindly following them this arc is absolute nonsense and the people who want to talk about its merits look back at the facts with a completely different view of what happened that Poe is impetuous and got people killed which has led him to this choice while in reality he has been the only character I can relate to as he makes continuously logical calls even though he's under extreme pressure to perform so he decides to call it and pull back from the fight finish shown to be at max speed straight shotting while the other speeders pull away and has a genuine character moment here John boyega is shown to even tear up as he says he can't let the first order win and pulls off his headset to ignore his team his time as a self concerned survivalist is over his time defending only himself and Rey is over he now wants to fight for a Cause against the first order and for his friends I don't think they performed the development properly in this film whatsoever for him but the concept is still appreciated as an arc and I had some investment in this scene as I kinda like Finn honestly they have a wide shot to show that he is the only speed ahead towards the cannon then it won't be long before impact the music Rises the choir echoes the ship begins to melt under the pressures he aims a straight shot to the cannon and jarringly the moment is cut short by rows clanking into him from the side rescuing him before he can make his move resulting in the destruction of the wall protecting the base there is so much wrong with this scene I hope you can actually keep up with me how didn't Finn get hit by 10 different walkers while he was the only speeder heading directly towards the cannon on a white battlefield when every other person was sniped with ease and the first order knew that these speeders are the only threat to the cannon that remains how didn't Rose get hit considering she managed to make it to the front line as well how logistically did Rose manage to not only get ahead of Finn but do it in a way that provided her enough time to make a 90-degree turn and knock Finn to safety before he made it to the cannon how did Rose know she wouldn't kill both of them by performing this move especially when Finn's ship was extremely weak thanks to the laser why in the world would Rose do this why did she prevent the saving of the resistance that her sister died to protect why is any of this happening this doesn't have any form of consistency whatsoever it's a huge joke it is brought up by the majority of critics as well as all of the people who actually loved the film they usually say this is the worst scene in the film but it's not over yet Finn unhurt from this entire ordeal demands to know why Rose stopped him and she replies with potentially the worst line of the entire saga of star wars I don't like sand no it's worse than that by a long shot Rose says I saved you that's how we're gonna win not fighting what we hate saving what we love where do I begin with this the resistance has made it clear that they are in a position that means this wall protecting them is all that's preventing their deaths so they sent out speeders to try and disable the cannonier's with that thing being active the resistance will be obliterated po demands they retreat because he doesn't believe it's possible without dying but Finn is happy to make that sacrifice as he cares more about the cause in general than he ever has before again this is a weird decision for both po and Finn in terms of their character development but ignoring that it is the current best choice for the survival of the resistance he will die to save the cause the people and the spark as they are so lovingly referred to but Rose stops him citing that he was making the wrong call and saving what we love is the better choice but that is exactly what he was doing saving the cause he has come to love this is exactly what Admiral hold oh did she died blowing up a huge portion of the enemy fleet and thus protecting what she loves this is exactly what Rosa's sister did she died blowing up the dreadnought before it could destroy the cruiser the thing that she loves because his sister was on it is Rose aware of what film she is in did they provide the actress a copy of the script the poetry of this is beyond she says all of this as the wall in the background is being blown open exposing the resistance to annihilation I can't imagine them filming her lines and this shot without laughing to be perfectly honest it makes antisense like there is no law or fan theory that explains this one it's just blatant incompetence and when people respond to this by saying don't take the film so seriously are they referring to no actual engagement whatsoever just sit there brain in hand and admire the colors or the explosions and the cute animals because this is absolutely ridiculous how does a functioning human watch this scene and not become insulted for the film expecting them to accept it as an endearing or even remotely insightful moment ROS then kisses fin and it is a strong signal for the audience to wince since they haven't made ROS and fin connect in that way for a single scene in the film not to mention that their chemistry is that of distant friends at best considering that Rose has made very strong criticisms of Finn throughout the film the romance may have actually been a rushed decision as well and considering the audience reaction online I doubt they'll pull this through to episode 9 I imagine JJ will practically have Rose stay in the coma for the rest of the saga since she was as big of a waste of time as canto bite and she took time away from the characters that we were developing already what a pointless character she is then made unconscious and so the film continues though it is really curious that Finn and Rose have not been shot yet since they're standing several meters away from the gorilla walkers and the film makes a point to show us this but never mind kyla then says general Hux advance no quarter no prisoners I know I've mentioned it before but this seriously frustrated me the progression made with kylo however poorly constructed has now been completely rolled back he wanted to be a sole force in the galaxy a man whose goals were his own and now he's just back at the helm of the first order commanding the deaths of innocence again he's really come a long way hasn't he it is then pointed out that each of the resistance sympathetic people across the galaxy were contacted they've heard the message but they are declining to help leia says they fought to the end and they did their best in a very defeated attitude the spark is out this is a scene of respect and reverence of what the resistance was as it has now reached its conclusion but I find it very difficult to get to that point considering that we have barely seen them in action and the first order has simply crushed without a sense of them ever being that impressive this is a will building problem again the writers are saying the resistance are now pretty much dead without much of a sense of what they were and the audience is left to respond with oh well that sucks I think even though we are fully aware that JJ will invent a brand new army in the third film because we have to have more struggles in space otherwise it wouldn't be Star Wars Luke then enters the room into the relief of the audience we finally get a second small scene that we can actually enjoy being fans of the original trilogy at least they utilized the characters in some way there is a little bit of humor and love shared between Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher as they channel their characters Luke says he's here to face kylo and he says he can't save him Leia says that his son is gone and this might be a result of the bridge being destroyed maybe Leia still thinks his son fired the missile but we don't find out either way Luke says that no one has ever truly gone which I'm sure is what many of the OT fans including myself are telling themselves about Luke's character anyway he gives lair the dice from the Falcon and moves on c-3po and Leia both give Luke an interesting look of surprise during this scene and Luke moves to the battlefield Luke then gets fired upon by an entire army of walkers completely shattering the ground around him Luke then makes a gesture like that's all you got loser the kind of thing you would expect if you could see the people playing against you on Xbox Live but Rian Johnson felt it would suit Luke now despite the character he's in the film being the complete opposite of this just another tonally aborted joke he's Jake Skywalker he's not my Luke Skywalker anyway kylo says he's going to meet Luke on the battlefield and for everyone to stay away until he is finished Hux complains about that and is promptly thrown across the room and we have a moment of a stormtrooper realizing what just happened and conforming immediately which I find funny because it's essentially the same scene as the force awakens it gives the stormtroopers more character almost like they're real people which was the opportunity with Finn but the idea of interesting people within the stormtroopers has all but been entirely forgotten could anyone really watch the last Jedi and infer that Finn was a stormtrooper I can't remember if there's a single reference to it other than the fact that he mopped the breaker room ryan johnson poorly handling a character you say ridiculous we are then shown that Finn is dragged roses body all the way from the walkers the resistance without any repercussions whatsoever this is literally not possible the ground where they were was white and to drag a body that distance would be insanity it leaves a big red trail behind you as well the destination is so far away do you remember how long it took them in their speeders to get from one side to the other but the writers clearly just wanted to teleport Finn and Rose back to safety now that they have completed their arcs some people speculate that they must have used a trench which if you look at the battlefield there is not a trench in sight that would get them from the front line of walkers to the base besides stop writing the script for them it's really annoying me kylo then says have you come back to forgive me to save my soul and Luke simply replies no he just he just says no a great uncle to to Ben solo and I feel tremendous guilt that I wasn't there for him no mock you would be horrible to your nephew as is your new character for myself for my entire life and having been on the other side of that curtain for the majority of my life Oh then decides that Luke must be doing this in order to give the resistance time to escape in the mines despite earlier saying there was absolutely no way out from the droids who scanned schematics but then the same droid says that there is now actually a chance of an opening he didn't mention this before because Ryan wanted the tension of the speeder scene but now that that scene is over he needs to get the resistance out of the mines so this is the thing now like these are the kind of writing issues you first learn about when you're becoming a writer I cannot believe he got away with this in the movie it's ridiculous more importantly I suppose is that Poe has opted out of a fight and instead decided to run which I guess is his character now despite every choice to fight made in this film by Poe being essentially the best one when you really think about the situation Poe is probably the only character who is mostly undamaged by this film and yet he is vilified by many characters for it Poe still operates in a way that we expect he's just criticized all the time for having the right perspective he then figures they should follow the crystallize fox things until they find an opening that they must have gone through and discovers that the hole is far too small for any of them to fit through though I don't know why this is a problem Leia can simply move the stones she is an established force user and she has a strong understanding of it apparently like the people who defend this film say she was trained or whatever even though that's not supported by the visual novels and it's actually not supported by Rian Johnson either but they have to be consistent come on Leia she just needs someone in the background to try and encourage her I guess doing Rey then gets to the other side and comments on this problem as a sigh and then says lifting rocks as if she will even have a lick of trouble from lifting that huge expanse of rock it is going to be absolutely fine she's even joking about it Luke and kylo then begin their battle and there is an extremely misplaced matrix move thrown in the fight which begs the question once again of how do people think these battles are superior to the ones in the prequels if you hate the ones in the prequels because of the dancing aspects then you should hate these ones after that Luke says I failed you Ben I'm sorry - which kylo responds I'm sure you are the resistance is dead the war is over and when I kill you I will have killed the last Jedi the only way for me to solve this crisis is to be Superman for the quest for peace oh yeah that's why they call it that aside from that I find it interesting that kylo is now referring to them as the resistance again good to get that back on track Ryan Luke then says every word of what you just said is wrong and I have to wonder here when Luke says you are wrong about everything you've just said is he also referring to the recognition of Luke's apology it makes this line very clunky but it's a great soundbite and Men you've used it on my previous Star Wars videos comments section so there's that I guess Luke then says the rebellion is reborn today the war is just beginning and I will not be the last Jedi so first of all they are interchanging the resistance and the rebellion again but I suppose it doesn't matter at this point because Luke is saying that they are one in the same we all knew that but it was the films that seemed to be in disbelief about it I guess the film has a character arc - nice work Ryan he says the war is just beginning which is an empty line as the war never seems to end in these films does it the best we get is a sort of peace in the off season we never see the peace but it exists and finally he says that he will not be the last Jedi which we already knew since he trained a bunch of people and some left with kylo and then not with him now so who knows which of them are alive or which of them are Jedi not to mention that there is a whole universe of force-sensitive people out there with the Jedi culture still being relevant in certain corners of it basically this line is only there to sound dramatic but again you guys already knew that it is crazy to think about the idea that Luke lost all of his students to the dark side including his nephew or they got killed and then he gave rise to the most powerful dark side user we have ever seen to simply run away to an island as you folks can see I still can't quite get over what they did to Luke anyway we then see Rey who is now lifting every one of those rocks that when put together likely way more than an x-wing she does this with the most bored and easygoing expression on his face because again she doesn't experience hardship she has no idea what that is and that's a part of a character by the way her arc is to actually get bored of being powerful fascinating kylo then says he will kill Rey as well and Luke responds strike me down in anger and I will always be with you just like your father which is a nice line it's a reference to the original fight with obi-wan but refitting it for a loved one rather than an enemy there's honestly some nice things in this film it's like 5% but it's this some stuff there kyla then strikes at Luke and his saber goes through him with no visible damage to speak of it turns out Luke is channeling an apparition of himself from the island he was in originally and the clues for this whether Luke did not leave a footprint on the ground as well as him looking very well-groomed layer and c3po likely knew he wasn't there as well but the real baffling moment of all of this is that kylo couldn't tell he wasn't there Luke is using a force technique which a force user would likely be able to detect but no he looks exactly the same as when kylo last saw him but no he's using a lightsaber that kylo broke not ten minutes ago but no this lightsaber is something that he's wanted for as long as we've known him but no finally ho could tell it was a division but kylo couldn't know why wouldn't Luke use his green lightsaber as seen in his memories with kylo what a strange and ill suiting choice we then see Rey and Leia can feel something is wrong and we cut back to Luke on the island who gives a worrying glance at his chest implying that he might have been injured by kylo / it was set up that things can move across the universe way back with kylo in the rain even with the ghost connections I bring this up in a very forced manner because I have no idea why they had this shot in the film if not for this reason like the whole brain realization that kylo has leads nowhere so this is what we're supposed to think I guess regardless Luke managed to fool kylo and rescue the resistance while referencing his own teachers death and leaving with a line that almost channelled Han Solo see you around kid this is a small reprieve for the people who respect Luke's character he was finally making a difference and he was protecting those he loves it's an okay start and hopefully we can see him climb back to his former dignity in the coming now he's dead literally killed because of the strain of performing the task of projection Ryan butchered his character and then has prevented him from being able to now fix it in any way shape or form Luke's handling in this film is honestly a Horror Story for so many fans and this finish is why he cannot redeem himself anymore he fades away into the force while staring at the binary sunset which reminds me of so many elements in this film gorgeous creative doesn't make any why are you killing the character why he didn't just go to the planet himself is beyond me as he has the force connection to lair knowing what kind of trouble they were in as well as an x-wing but he used a ghost instead which one would assume means he would at least prevent his own death by doing so but he still died it's hard to believe but that's what we get not just in the story but in reference to his character as a whole he spent the film being a coward only to force project himself across the world and then perish there are many arguments in response to this so let's explore them this was a fantastic arc for Luke it made sense and it allowed us to see a side to Luke that we would otherwise have been without to end his arc it's fantastic this is fine but I've already said this is not Luke Skywalker and what does that mean exactly well when you assess the characters from the OT and you give a selection of ways to describe them those words cannot describe this new character this is how characters work they are defined by their traits their descriptors I mean this would still be possible as there are characters at the beginning of television shows that are almost polar opposites by the end and it can be fantastic storytelling because we see them struggle and grow but we didn't see how Luke got here we don't even understand it we have nothing to grip to and even if we did this is not a direction that explores much of anything about him as a character he is disheveled and defeated only to be heroic sort of and then dies I think it really comes down to the scene where we see Luke maniacally attempting to murder his own sister's son someone you should be nurturing and protective of it is so hard to help people understand when they sit on the other side of the fence they will make many arguments for it like this Luke made a mistake in thinking about killing Ben it was a rash momentary decision that he realizes was wrong Kyle owes potential future scared him and he faltered for a moment he showed weakness and you know what that makes him an even better character Indiana Jones would never beg for mercy or cry during a fistfight Ellen Ripley would never leave people she loves to die in order to save herself Harry Potter would never sell his friends and his children for money Jack Sparrow would never sober up and work out the best political route to help the people in his area and Luke Skywalker wouldn't attempt to murder his own apprentice his nephew his sister and best friends son while he slept Luke valued his family more than anything it's a part of what defines him as a character this is what Star Wars was about and to see him this way is heartbreaking Vader was a mass murdering monster who acted as the fist that destroyed the Jedi in the Republic he couldn't be topped in terms of a source of pure evil and yet Luke saved him because he was his father but he couldn't even be bothered to try and save this innocent little boy who's not only a blood relative but his own student many people blame the force awakens for all of this and that is a deflection there were things you could do to work with the ending JJ provided he'll just give me a spin-off movie to write Disney I'll fix it all for you we could crowdsource ideas to get your property back on track at this point I'm trying to help you make money but yes many people will say that Luke is fictional and he can become whatever he is written to be and they are absolutely right but you still have to put in the work to understand the history of the character and his motivations not to mention you need to bridge the gap between himself now and 30 years plus ago for those who don't understand the biggest takeaway for so many fans the original trilogy was not that they connected to the name Luke Skywalker it was the person the man himself and this film wanted to take that away take away what made the heart connect directly to the writing itself what a shame kylo then enters the base with snow troopers wait snow troopers the planet isn't even cold everyone is wearing casual clothing even Rey the girl who is used to hot climates so it must be fairly mild are these troopers wearing protective gear for the salt but are these salt troopers what is happening just sell the toys guys please just sell the toys for the love of God we then see Rey close the door on kylo potentially severing their connection he then finds dice from the Millennium Falcon which fades in to nothing like Luke did is just weird that it did it separately from Luke Poe then meets ray for the first time apparently and Fidan sees the Jedi books are safely secured in the draw and the Falcon Finn makes sure that Rose is okay and Leia comforta ray-ray says that Luke may be gone but he left in peace and purpose I would like to remind the writers that just because you say Luke left with peace and purpose does not make it true Leia then says they have everything they need to build brand-new rebellion despite proving earlier that they have no reliable allies they also have no ships aside from the Millennium Falcon no vehicles men money power or goals other than to topple the first order somehow honestly why would anyone join the resistance they are about 20 people and a small ship I would understand people joining when they strike at the heart of the Empire and succeed but now of all times when they've been reduced to almost nothing and the first order still has massive power what's that nothing making sense or a conclusion aside from that it is sad to refer to the startup of the horrors of war once again a reset of 30-plus years as a fun exciting thing you would think there would be more grief considering the events of this movie so many people have died but we have to get right back into space Wars don't wait no time to absorb the events no time to grow with these characters we close on children telling stories of Luke Skywalker standing up to the first order and showing that these children are force sensitive as one uses the force to pick up his broom this is probably in reference to anyone all over the world now being able to simply have the force and be powerful with it and Luke's apparent sacrifice was somehow told to other members of the galaxy despite their only being about 20 people on the Falcon who didn't even witness what Luke did are you telling me that the first order of spread stories of Luke's heroic sacrifice of disappearing after he tricked kylo why is that an inspiring story anyway like can you imagine someone trying to tell this story from the perspective of any of the members of the first order hey Frank what happened well it's a weird thing you know you know you know some guy in robes he he he he like came out of the out of the big hole that we blew open and in a and kylo went down to fight him and they sort of had a back-and-forth and and then and then the guy in the robes disappeared I don't I don't have any idea what happened yeah that's an inspiring story regardless this will apparently inspire a new generation to potentially join the rebellion because reasons and the film is then over what a horrifying disaster we had ray go from being this new powerful force user who's going to meet a legendary Jedi Knight we now have this powerful force user who turns out was only hindered by both kylo and Luke and now understands that she's going to dominate in the next film when she rescues the galaxy we had Finn a defecting stormtrooper with no cause worth fighting until he met ray and was crippled trying to defend her we now have Finn who wastes two hours of screen time hanging out with a new friend we've never met only to receive an extremely weird kiss from her at the end while seeing ray for about 30 seconds in total we had Poe a hotshot pilot who blew us away on screen with his charisma intelligence and talent we now have Poe an overly aggressive narrow-minded fool who learns not to be out of order we had kylo a confused lonely angry Darth Vader obsessed psychopath who wants power and a reason to become who he feels he should be we now have kylo a sometimes gentle caring soul who wants to rid the world of the false dichotomy and move on to a new and interesting world with no overarching figure to tell him all the people he respects what to do oh no sorry we just have the same old Kyla we always had what am I talking about we had Snoke a mysterious dark power in the universe who took care of himself and waited for the best times to strike we now have Snoke a gold slippers and gown wearing self-obsessed cartoon villain who dies because he was a fool we had Luke a man who saved his family and his friends from tyranny a hero at the very core a beloved icon who pushed the galaxy towards freedom and happiness we now have Luke a sad old toad who wanted the death of his family in order to feel satisfied that he was in charge only to run away when he failed and hope to die with a minor Redemption at the end showing that there was just a sparkle of his actual character left Ryan what have you done no character that was given any kind of focus escaped this insane need to run them into the ground when you try and give your characters a low point in the trilogy that doesn't mean you start to write them in ways that betrays their foundations character is literally the foundation of Star Wars without that the films are hollow space adventures the crazy powers the environments the tools the tech none of it matters compared it's all dressing character was the most important and you've literally sapped the core out of them all almost surgically the film is such a major collection of horrible writing in so many different ways that people have to rise to an insane level to defend it we can't talk about the actual events that take place or what the characters do it has to be recontextualized into a theme so that the film raises itself to a masterpiece in art form nearly every argument for the quality of this film ignores the mechanics of the writing and simply spills the word theme all over the internet so before jumping into patterns or conclusions how about we look at themes and the social commentary the social aspects to this film have royally annoyed many people in the world and this film has earned a title of being very left-leaning I do not like to get political on my channel ever but this film has very much pushed an agenda so let's tackle these ideas individually and neutrally there is a strong theme against capitalism nobody will deny that in canto bite we're dealing with rich people laughing while poor people suffer and the reason is trade on very immoral markets this is very blunt and poorly handled as it doesn't even remotely make sense within the universe and it's covered extremely briefly anti capitalism is a rising perspective as time goes on so it does feel as though it is pandering rather than exploring a meaningful idea about the system itself and the problems that comes with it though I would personally say that this is extremely inappropriate as content to try and brush over during a Star Wars film and let's just ignore the fact that Disney are using a property they bought for millions and have sold again and again for billions to teach us about how bad capitalism is how ridiculous next would be that animal cruelty is bad and this may be an attempt to make capitalist look even worse but I would provide the movie with the benefit of the doubt and assume they are simply saying it is bad in general this is pretty much cartoonish as I've already stated it is mostly rushed and doesn't take a lick of reality into account of what will happen to these animals if they are saved there isn't anything clever being done here is very simple the animal is cute and now it is free then we have slavery is bad which law agrees with in most first world countries it's not made to be something that's right in your face but I think it's more of a subset of the criticisms of capitalism which again isn't very clever in terms of reroute to go to just showing us children suffering and then blaming these evil rich men seems very agenda-driven and I find myself asking what the point of all of this is I know there are evil men and women in real life you know there are evil people in real life I came to the science fantasy movie to watch fictional characters deal with fictional problems set up in a will Derulo's instead of being handed this very quick understanding of bad things in the world that has no relevance once they leave canto bite so the social aspects to it genuinely seem forced and they also pander to a more left-leaning audience I am sure that people on the Left would agree with this even if they consider the message correct which is not actually something I am discussing here I am simply pointing out of the film is clearly left-leaning which is frustrating for everybody who enjoys Star Wars and does not lean left well then on to the themes the most common discussions I could find on this where the themes of failure communication greed development Redemption and morality failure is indeed throughout the movie as well as the word being spread around each character has at least some form of failure Finn fails to stop the tracker Poe fails to understand the plan Rey fails to see the truth about kylo Luke fails to train kylo correctly kylo fails to see the truth about Rea Snoke fails to see Tyler's true intentions Huck's fails as a commanding officer aldo fails to reassure her crew etc so many failings all around and that's that's right right well neither I nor the person who comes up with these lists are finished they will tell you that this elevates the film by spotting this pattern you have now revealed the genius of the writing it made you consider failure and how it teaches us to progress as Yoda says the best teacher failure is what do I say to this well most if not all plot lines and character developments we just went over for the last 4 hours don't make sense they weren't supported by the previous films nor were they well executed they simply happened the best example being posed he didn't fail throughout the movie when you actually consider his actions Finn only failed because the writer decided that a BB unit saw his team things like this forced me to come to the conclusion that yes Rian Johnson wanted this theme and he shoehorned events to make it happen but this makes the writing even worse he put a theme over the characters over the plot to force the characters around the theme to make you think about it on your own personal level to ignore how inconsistent the writing is to appear more intellectual the theme I just went over is also reinterpreted to redemption loss or learning depending on who you speak to but that should cover it the next theme people rave about is communication many characters fail because of bad communication or accidental communication so this includes stuff like Poe muting Leia or Luke being blocked off from communication via the force or kylo and rey having calls being interrupted regularly or finn causing the destruction of transports due to his communication with Poe this will now reveal the actual intentions of finding themes people love pattern recognition hell I love it and I'm gonna be doing it with you guys very soon but when you have no patterns to find in terms of positive pieces of writing within film you begin to invent them another phrase for this would be you are reading too much into this the apparent theme of communication is simply an extension of the previous theme about failure the theme that every character does something wrong and it leads to the death or destruction of something you can now reconnect your lies it into a lack of communication instead of failure in general Luke failed to communicate his teachings to kylo hold o failed to communicate well to her crew Finn failed to stop his communication with Poe resulting in the deaths of the people in the transports Poe failed to communicate with whole dough in a respectful manner resulting in his lack of information Rey failed to communicate what she needed to to kylo it goes on and on and the people who love the movie will latch on to every new theme that they can find with this perspective it allows them to ignore criticism because a theme is above that you can't kill an idea right from there the themes of greed morality and development are all as ham-fisted as the rest you can take a character take their plot for the movie and warp it around your idea for example you guys don't have to believe me but I shot at a random idea in my head a random weird I decided on resurrection so I declare that there is a theme of resurrection in Star Wars the last Jedi liturgist thrown a dart bored of words and we have resurrection let's go gilli pelo allows the dark side in him to falter and resurrect part of the light po resurrects the part of him that wants to maintain the cause rather than trying to be a hero laya is resurrected by the force Finn resurrects his interesting causes as he lost that when the first order revealed their true nature Yoda is resurrected through the force as a teacher for Luke Luke resurrects his faith in the Jedi and in the people who perform good for the galaxy giving the resistance a spark of hope Rey resurrects our own sense of self-worth instead of waiting on her parents to do it for her Snoke and Huck's have successfully resurrected the Empire at the beginning of the film is this ham-fisted absolutely is this somebody on the planet who thinks that this theme of resurrection is actually present in this film almost certainly but this is what people are resorting to in order to define this movie as well-written it's frustrating to have to deconstruct the social commentary is certainly there in more ways than one but themes are so subjective that when you try to pry into them people will get defensive claiming that you cannot say what you've just said you can't say that the themes don't exist but these themes place the content on a shelf that cannot be considered bad it is the way that they circumvent the entire criticism of the film the movie is now immune to being the title of bad content well I hate to break this to you my precious audience but if you watch my other work I am one of the people on the internet who will tell you and simultaneously argue to the death that there is such a thing as objective value to content it sits comfortably alongside subjective value these are two very different things you love the themes that's nice but the film is still horribly written meaning that the value you have defined from the project itself is simply for you it is not measurable or provable in fact when put under a lens it is the opposite now let's look at some patterns that actually exists and why they represent rot in the spine of this film I will start with an easy target marketing within the script for context I'll simply say pawggs crystal foxes and phasma all of these things only exist for marketing and marketing alone serving an additional purpose is only a way to escape the criticism narrowly also I would like to make a disclaimer just because I'm creating an argument for the lack of quality for this film that may apply to other Star Wars films that does not mean the star wars films are the same as this film do you understand that point good I'm only naming this set of three to prove a pattern I don't want to spend too long on this point but let's look a little closer at them pogs are cute and playful they were introduced apparently to CGI over puffins that are local to skellig michael which is the island that Luke is on for the film but then each scene therein is played for laughs and cuteness rather than simply being there to cover up these local creatures then they begin to pop up in the Millennium Falcon and thus the rest of the film will you actually honestly argue that puffins are also local to the salt planet exactly so stop pushing that excuse I don't think anyone can actually see these things as anything but a marketing prop but I don't think they're gonna be as successful as minions or emojis whatsoever the problem with them is that they absorb a decent chunk of screen time to be funny for the sake of it it doesn't add pacing or tension in fact it usually conflicts with the tone of the proceeding or post scenes as I have made clear previously it is more about doing it whenever there has been a decent gap without them to remind the audience that these cute little darlings are in fact small enough to buy but the true nail in their coffin of purpose is Chewbacca a character who has had a strong connection to Han Luke and Leia with his own skillset and purpose within the film's he is now reduced to the pawggs sidekick Chewie has sunk so low that now he is no more developed or interacted with than the cuddly creatures we assume were placed in there for marketing purposes marketing is more important than the writing and as much as people claim that to be applicable to all of the films just think about Chewbacca in the last Jedi okay how about a pattern constructed by those crazy original trilogy fans that they only brought old characters back to humiliate them does that work with super Leia yes how about cowardly Luke yes watched upon yes killed off screen for no reason Akbar yes and I think Chewie speaks for himself well that was easy next up we have editing there is a strong pattern with the editing that we have essentially covered throughout my videos being that it is very choppy and mediocre in terms of the art itself so what I'm talking about here are instances where there are shortcuts and mistakes made that you would not expect for such a high budget film these are the biggest offenders phasma's sudden loss and gaining of a gun the teleporting bombers the turret that came out and went out no we're holders visit to the hangar Rey teleporting from Stokes throne room to crate without a single connecting scene phasma and his stormtroopers disappearing without a trace time being something that is avoided for consistency's sake the army of troopers and the BB unit coming in from nowhere see ultimately you can call this a directing issue or even a writing issue as these may be all the editor could work with but assuming he had all the connecting scenes it makes no sense to put the film together like this it was rushed as well as incompetent an audience is not supposed to be hit with things like this when you're accomplished and experienced as a writer director teamed with an editor it is so beyond amateurish because it steals investment from people how do you remain immersed when you can't follow simplistic events like people going to places and objects existing that was easy so let's move on to tonal confusion these are essentially the prank call with Huck's while the stakes are rising for the destruction of the resistance Luke throwing his lightsaber over his shoulder after a scene that gave his intro respect and reverence the mutiny mixed in with the iron joke Rey being bonked by the lightsaber while trying to kill the main villain Luke brushing off the assault despite the way his character had been built and so on I don't think you need to understand much about the pattern here or why it's bad since it is very obvious don't provide your audience with multiple conflicting emotions at the same time it is distracting it also cuts right through the immersion Disney has been criticized for this when I am certain that this is Rian Johnson instead Disney have control over Marvel Studios right now and people are saying that this is totally inappropriate because they tend to shove in jokes where they do not work I disagree there are great and terrible jokes in Marvel films they take place in ways that can get in the way of the grief that happens within the films or they sit comfortably alongside them I want to make a series of videos on Marvel this is because I have a lot to say about the shifting quality throughout the films as well as some of the greatest tragic writing I've seen for a superhero but for now I have noticed a pattern that when people say a Marvel film fails miserably people often criticize Disney for tanking it meddling with it in the background and basically strangling the director or the writer when the movie succeeds you'll hear praises for the individual director striking out and carrying the film so it seems very stacked against Disney I don't think Disney agreat as an entity far from it honestly for me the film usually gets informed by the pass work of the director or writer and then some extra stuff you can get from social media or interviews about meddling though overall I have not gotten the impression that Disney are to blame for this huge amount of comedy in modern Marvel films or lack thereof for example Ragnarok is easily one of the funniest films I have seen to date yes ooh me I know lots of people hated the comedy like the Dishonored wolf guy but his video on Ragnarok is honestly terrible it lacked any kind of cogent argument which is unfortunate because his video on Star Wars the last Jedi was actually great it was chock-full of passion at logical arguments but there we are this is a taste of my work by the way for new fans I have no compunction about criticizing my peers they get as good as they give and I expect the same regardless the reason I think Ragnarok is so funny compared to other Marvel films is the director Tycho ytt especially considering his past work then further to the middle of the scale I think guardians the galaxy vol 1 balance humor and action-oriented drama fantastically which I genuinely attribute to James Gunn and his past work finally on the edge of the other side of the scale we have Captain America Civil War a film that seems to have mainly been sprinkling humor among much more dramatic elements with moments that genuinely pull the heartstrings but you know what Civil War had some great jokes in it they were timed and delivered with a suitable context and a strong understanding of the characters who were delivering the lines and then when Civil War needed to be quiet serious and heart-wrenching it pulled it off without a hitch the point here is I don't think Disney is the one to blame for this horrid mismatching of tone in the last Jedi when it comes down to bad timing misunderstood characters inappropriate tone and lowbrow humor I think it's the writer directors fault since the writer controls what these characters are saying and how they perform their actions while the director makes sure it happens as they saw it in their head is Disney responsible for the film yes but I see Ryan Johnson's hands all over this project not simply Disney just like I see JJ Abrams all over the force awakens not simply Disney so yes on with the patterns next up would be the phrase style over substance this is of course in reference to the idea that you put your eye candy before you're writing films like Speed Racer Enter the Void transformers 300 and Evita are also used as examples in this sort of genre if you can call it that some of those examples are far worse than others but you get point the last Jedi has a strong pattern of style over substance let's go through a few so you know what I'm talking about phasma disappears and then reappears in smoke making no sense but it looks imposing the hyperspace jump makes no sense in universe but it looks incredible the destruction of the bridge on the raddest makes no sense but it looks impactful the bomber ships make no sense but they reference World War two bombers which looks striking phasma falling into a sudden pit of fiery death makes no sense but it looks intense basically a lot of things happen for the sake of the visual or sometimes it'll be a writing tool but I am more concerned with the former special effects in the OT were revolutionary may describe space battles for the most part grounded space battles for lack of a better term things were gritty and realistic within their own rule set in terms of the props for the most part the prequels then basically turned everything into digital goos spread across the walls and floors all over the place trying to make a more science-fiction environment most of the time it informed the events at hand but it was clearly going way too far in many places crafting environments that looked all too similar or basically too much noiz on the screen but the new trilogy is using some very expensive techniques in direction and CGI to create shots that are less about informing the events or describing the world or grounding the elements it is meant to dazzle distract and impress even if it is detrimental to the script to the logic of the universe and to the understanding of the audience this is common throughout the movie and it worked wonders how many people have you heard say this is the best looking Star Wars movie this is the most gorgeous Star Wars movie I've ever seen one of the best looking films I have ever seen and these people aren't wrong it is a beautiful film and those lights colors and noises are enough to take most people away from the horribly written story this is a pattern enough in the film that I'm almost certain is by design dazzled that audience don't let them think about what's happening under the hood next up would be conveniences and this film is hemorrhaging with those more so than I've seen in a long time and it's a real shame because it breaks rules from the established universe as well as the film's own rules this is a classic era in writing it includes stuff like oh no you got caught and placed in space prison but it's fine because you found a locksmith inside who doubles as your code breaker who doubles as your only ticket out of the place who doesn't need to be paid Wow oh no the first orders fleet have caught you and you can't jump to hyperspace but it's fine they can't catch up with you as they're too slow Wow oh no you were locked in a dead-end and the first order is on its way but it's fine there's a way out through the back now Wow oh no Leia has been blown out the airlock by a massive explosion but it's fine she's the force Wow Oh No Rey has been captured by the first order and she's at the mercy of Snoke ran and Huck's but it's fine Snoke dies Ren's unconscious and there's a transport nearby that gets it to the Millennium Falcon Wow there are hundreds more but you get my point as you probably noticed these patterns are getting worse in nature and this one is a death by a thousand cuts there are conveniences in most if not all stories things that happen that make you think to yourself okay the writer made this happen in order for X to happen it did not feel natural or realistic this is not something that is in the last Jedi this is something that encompasses the last Jedi there isn't an attempt to stick to your guns and fight out of the situation the characters are put in some of them should downright be dead or at the very least suffering massively but Rian Johnson just writes them back out an investment in the world or the situations presented plummets from an already dreary position but let's get to the pattern that everyone recognized subversion which would be stuff like Luke throwing his lightsaber off the cliff Snoke only wanting Rey to get to Luke killing Leia only to bring her back Snoke was noting Poe is the only one who's wrong the whole time kylos Darkseid training meant kill Ray Ray's parents are no.1 again you get it now the pattern has one strong purpose and that is to create new and interesting content based solely on what the audience expects to see I use The Departed as an example of what you can do to benefit from such a choice but why doesn't it work with the last Jedi Snoke being nothing adds nothing to the story killing Leia and bringing her back immediately was almost filler because it was a springboard for hold oh and that writing nightmare and ultimately it adds nothing to the story Luke throwing the lightsaber off the cliff was tone-deaf and added nothing to the story Poe was reasonable and heroic but then forced to be a fool for no reason which added nothing to the story kylos history with the darkside and training and meeting with Snoke was incredibly simple and added nothing to the story kylos darkside training simply meant kill which added nothing to the story ray having no relevant parents adds nothing to the story each of these results of events set up by either the film itself or the force awakens could have opened up huge possibilities for the progression and the characters but instead they are shunted in favor of nothing by virtue of it not being something people saw coming this is an argument that is circulating the internet a lot the story is simply taking paths you didn't want it to if I wanted Palpatine to be raised grandfather and it turned out to be goal a boon to the traveling merchant who knows much about the force and the first order yet stays neutral until he meets Rey after abandoning her I would be interested to see what they can do with that but I wouldn't be angry that they didn't do the Palpatine thing do you understand when they subvert me and say that it turns out it wasn't anything that can be pretty disappointing and frustrating you took my investment and laughed at me for having it you laughed at me for caring about a story you were telling you can't take all of these elements be aware of what everyone is excited for and then turn it into a brown shallow sludge throw it in people's faces and laugh at them claiming that it is great because it's averted your expectations by doing nothing innovative whatsoever the way this works is once upon a time stories were a little bland ER and simpler with extremely predictable endings like the hero wins the victims are saved and the bad guy is dead but then as time went on the less predictable stuff started to happen is the bad guy evil do the victims get saved did the hero win and now we have loads of this sort of thing in media loads of attempts to tell new and interesting stories Game of Thrones is practically built upon this idea so subversion is like trying to find the ending that nobody's done yet the one that nobody expects yet wanted to see without realizing it Rian Johnson decided to come full circle and now he believes the most basic and boring ideas and storytelling have become subversion and therefore celebratory because no one else is using them and as we all know subverting expectations in and of itself is an accomplishment satisfying it is narrative Lee you see I subverted your expectations oh my god Verdun the subversion you thought was going to happen in the first place happens you know I like plot twists that that make the story less interesting but I'm satisfied because he's inverted my expectations Star Wars this infects the film horrendously as large character or story based decisions are being deflected and deflated or forgotten in order to be different because it was too difficult to create something new and truly subversive now you have to go is simply saying it was all for nothing please clap comparatively this film also engages in subversion because it is getting away from the tropes of the previous film quote-unquote but it also Apes off them in spades so many scenes and pieces of dialogues stolen directly from episode 5 and 6 under the guise of a cyclical nature a referential homage to the older films when the whole defense for the film is that it isn't taking the root of those films the last Jedi amounts to the premise of episode 5 with a strange be plot that everyone hates leading to the end of episode 6 and then back to the beginning of episode 5 otherwise known as Frankenstein's monster a mismatch cluster of ripped ideas with inconsistent threads attempting to connect them and horrible shallow or useless endings to several ideas spawned in the first movie it's as long as you subvert expectations it doesn't matter what you do it's so effective you of terrible b-movie because this episode should have ended 20 minutes ago the thing is vert agura expected narrative Lee it might you know make your entire movie fall on its face but you subverted expectations expectations that were subvert 'add know we only have two patterns remaining first being the plot holes this film has a metric ton of plot holes and the best defense people tend to have for this one is well you don't know the actual definition of plothole so let's start here in fiction a plot hole plot hole or plot error is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by a story's plot such inconsistencies includes such things as illogical or impossible events and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline so do we have many examples of this the first order is galactically powerful despite being established as small within the galaxy the Dreadnought does not use life scanners shown to be extremely useful in the past so if his cannons are still ineffective against fighters despite their apparent 60 year history of being developed there is no use of y-wings despite them being far more effective as well as b-wings the first order have a device that never loses track of a ship as long as they viewed it once this has never been done in the saga before and we can expect it to cause major problems in the future films one fighter has the ability to destroy the bridge on the hangar bay of a major cruiser with a single pair of missiles despite this never happening before layer uses one of the most powerful force abilities in history with no understanding of the force Finn thinks hyperspace tracking is impossible despite having mopped the area supporting the device itself Rey translates for Luke despite him knowing Chewie for 30-plus years and I'm already gonna stop this is ridiculous you can already watch my previous videos for the rest of them but again you get the point the film is rotting with plotholes things happening with no prior reasoning whatsoever or people not knowing things when they should do in order to be more dramatic or shocking which brings us to the final obvious pattern that I have spotted when faced with this tsunami of writing issues people will try any and all methods to brave the storm we have been through pretty much all of them in this series but there is something about them that you guys may not have noticed people writing Ryan Johnson's script for him they fill in the gaps massive character histories willed rules and explanations of inconsistent events to make the film stronger because it cannot survive on its own and this is outside of the third party information as well this is akin to placing scaffolding on a building after it's been built in order to run repairs only here the story is desperately falling apart let me give you some examples of things people have said as if they come from the while they actually come from their own fan fictions or headcanons the new bombers we use because the classic bombers weren't good enough to destroy the dreadnought fin pulled rows into a trench and got him back to the base without being seen by the first order that way the material that created phasma's Armour is limited to the point where they could only make one for her the bombs on the ship were magnetized Leia trained with Luke for the thirty year gap the resistance set their speed to be exactly as fast as the max speed of the first order to evade them there was a force field in the bomber to prevent the vacuum of space the hyperspace move was suitable for the situation at hand where it wouldn't have been in every single battle previously in the series Leia had an adrenaline boost thus allowing her to perform abilities that no other Jedi could the codebreaker is a drunk who sleeps off small crimes waiting for someone he can help to end up in jail - do you understand the pattern here people will actively create their own story in their own heads to ignore the flaws within the script pulling in universal rules to match their scenarios and hope that if they can just plug up each of these little holes in the film itself then it will remain a masterpiece and that is honestly sad why can't we have a conversation about the reality of the situation why do we have to invent a fiction to make the fiction make more sense why don't we instead just talk about the genuine quality of the film to the people who have to invent the narrative to improve the quality of the film I say this you told many fans that their expectation ruined the experience of the film that they wanted to see their own ideas on screen that they shouldn't have been speculating or writing fan fiction of their own you are doing the exact same thing in Reverse right now when you invent your own head cannon in order to like the film please have some self-awareness ultimately you are upset by the fact that you enjoyed the film despite its heavy flaws and so you told yourself a better story to get around that you told yourself you watched a better film so hopefully you can now understand with the chronological retelling of the film combined with a series of writing patterns that this is extremely poor the film itself is carried by its name and if this was the plot of a b-movie that no one cared about it would be sitting at a safe one to two out of ten imagine what the end result of this film would have been without the money behind it to fund the actors the set pieces and the CGI these things don't matter in the grand scheme not even the assets poached from Star Wars as a franchise they do not matter to the writing the effects will age the shots will age every choice will age writing and storytelling is timeless some of the greatest stories are not modern when the prequel trilogy was being released the majority of fans loved it I didn't even really think there was a single thing wrong with the movies but that was because I was too young to think critically when the prequels were given years and years of exposure not to mention plink its reviews the film's sank dramatically almost turning into a complete joke only to now enter the counterculture that Dark Souls 2 is entered where people are now actively defending the prequels as great films instead as if we miss something honestly folks I love the prequels you may have spotted that from the amount of footage I've used in these videos they have a special place in my heart and I could talk about the positives in them all day but they are objectively poorly written films perhaps I can go over in more detail on that one day regardless mark my words the last Jedi sycophants will come around you have to give them time once they do potentially years from now the general view on the last Jedi will be it's the one that killed the modern trilogy and the one that potentially killed the franchise profitability as the OT fans were already gone thanks to episode 7 but for the ones that remained and the fan base that was built by the modern trilogy a huge portion of them have been completely severed thanks to this new film ok I'm getting ahead of myself I do that a lot let's conclude all of this properly people seem to think that fantasy is a genre and subsequently science fiction or space operas do not adhere to rules this is a myth and a poorly propagated one good writing adheres to rules bad writing forgets them this is monumentally simplistic if we can't agree on this if you seriously don't understand my perspective you're on the wrong Channel in addition to this people are saying you cannot judge the film without having seen its sequel because that will end this film but as we know from Rian Johnson there was no road map and as much as JJ Abrams will attempt to fix what Ryan has done here he will be unsuccessful I can promise you that you can absolutely judge a huge portion of the elements in the last Jedi without having seen the ninth episode the suggestion that you can't is simply a smokescreen to ward off criticism like every other argument in favor of this film's writing which many have criticized me for digging into citing the plot holes and inconsistencies can be found in EV movie first of all know there are movies with airtight writing you just haven't seen them secondly a handful of plot holes or conveniences are a little bit different to massive canyon sized ones it's all about context to try and turn the conversation into a binary checkbox is ridiculous there are places on the scale for films to fall in between if they have a handful of small conveniences the film can of course still be great but not when it's literal Swiss cheese regardless once you get to this point in the conversation the goalposts will then be moved to their final position in terms of argumentation this is a quote from the comments section that is echoed in many places across the internet you don't search for logic in a Star Wars movie a movie full of laser weapons noisy explosions in space and little Muppets running around you need to remember that this is a movie first with visual metaphor and it's not a documentary about real things happening in space all right it's time once and for all to destroy this argument what if the ninth episode of the series opens with Luke saying the syph must end - I totally forgot sorry lawl I'm sleepy I guess and he jumps wearing only a nappy into space he chops every last Death Star Star Destroyer etc in half and kicks the supremacy into a local Sun he then stands on the Sun and says kylo you must return to the Jedi because they are actually okay and really cool and so kylo does rey and kylo get married Luke begins to date pocha Barker becomes a Jedi Finn discovers that he was snoke's father and finally Leia says the rebellion is reborn as a new invader arrives his name is glom setting up the sequel trilogy as glom the Sith Lord has brought the mighty army of flam's which are legendary Sith warriors would that be something you consider bad because if you did if you said to me that this is terrible writing do you know what I'd say back to you you don't search for logic in a Star Wars movie a movie full of laser weapons noisy explosions in space and little Muppets running around you need to remember that this is a movie first with visual metaphor and not a documentary about weel thing happening in pH yeah it isn't fun to have to swallow your own medicine but it raises a good point and that is that there is a scale for all of us we just place things differently overall I think the key is to actually figure out what gaile to agree on first and then move forward huh okay then finally you have to agree that the original films were just as flawed right they were flawed but nowhere near as much as this mess and fundamentally the originals had some incredible characters to connect to what does this movie have the reasonable fool the flawless slate the directionless friend the incompetent hero the person who is there and of course the cowardly grump I don't know about you guys but I can't wait to get the figures for this lot to play extra stories for them in the games to read about their adventures in the novels to imagine what they got up to in between films yeah sounds like a lot of time well spent ultimately this film is a strong fan base and that is fine since there are millions of people who are watching it there's obviously going to be a strong fan base for the positive people still loved it but the more worrying part is that it punched a hole in many of them more for some reason respected reviewers on this site it is being praised as a masterpiece with flaws a fantastic addition to the saga as well as potentially the best Star Wars film yet which is bizarre to me and many others considering everything we've covered in the last four in a bit hours they are making conscious efforts to convince you that this is actually good content these new Star Wars movies can be better than the original ones I mean guys are essentially the same stories but with better action better jokes better characters better effects oh god I can hear those million voices again I'm sorry stop right there you ridiculous person I think that red letter media hit the nail on the head for this sort of thing with the nerd crew podcast that it's a money thing especially with people from new rock stars it's way more profitable to be nice and happy for everything than to be horrible to everything you are child friendly as well as pleasing to those who genuinely liked the film and how many people are going to rip into you for saying that you simply liked something but yeah I've been sent so many videos on defending this film that I've essentially gotten to the point where I couldn't respond to them in a consistent manner other than summing up each argument as we went through on top of that there are some more people who have covered it that I think worth mentioning by name we have the nostalgia critic cinemassacre looper new rock stars obviously movie Bob Kevin Smith and a bunch of others that have really strained the content to find the positives and they have painted a different picture than the disaster that it actually is YMS completely missed the mark rather than assessing the inconsistencies as a whole he ignored them and only focused on one or two that he actually recognized claiming that the reaction to the film's quality was unwarranted which is actually something a lot of people apparently if only we had an arbiter to tell us how we should be reacting sadly even Jenny Nichols strawman the perspective of the people who didn't like the film you know you you live long enough to become a villain that sort of thing there's a strange behavior surrounding this film and its critics like people genuinely ignoring thousands of blatant mistakes on top of horrid choices for the plot and characters I understand why some of you think they are paid off but maybe it is really just as simple as they don't see their own bias they're not being critical ultimately in Janie's case maybe she was the perfect person to deconstruct Suicide Squad but she's just not very good when it comes to Star Wars you'll be the same thing if I covered something like the Bourne trilogy I really don't know what I'm talking about with them because I never really liked them I just saw them you know like I'm the wrong person to do it oh this should explain by the way that you shouldn't really make requests for films outside of maybe Star Wars episodes because I'm only good at certain things and that's what I stick to anyway we're kind of hoping for a great planket review but the problem is that he's he's a bit strange these days he spent 60% of his force awakens' review ripping into the prequels you could say that I'm worried about what he's gonna do with the last Jedi I mean I love red letter media but the obsession was saying something nobody else has said is now cornering them into weird reviews that almost come across as botched in a lot of ways I don't think this is terrible it's sporadically interesting that's a very good yes yes you know guys they these people they might actually really think the film is great and they want to defend it as much as they possibly can with any argument they can find so I'm providing an open invitation to any of these people we can have a fun little debate about the quality of this film I think will be really fun because ultimately for those of you who are new to my channel this may shock you but Star Wars the last Jedi is objectively bad content it is provable this is factual you may enjoy the film and even love the film that's absolutely fine but it is a poorly written film that stands as an objective insult to intelligence everything positive said about the film is either about the superficial elements that take money to generate all the objective arguments that stem from themes to interpretations to feelings the vast majority of my points aren't about perspective we're talking about facts and if you don't agree with them then it will be difficult to have discussions in the future because this is precisely how one creates a scale and moves on from it if you think the last Jedi is great good luck ever calling other films bad unsubscribe regardless as I said there is an open invitation to these creators to have a debate with me I think the biggest defender and the one I would love to debate the most would be I hate everything his video were sorry what what you guys want me to respond to his video specifically and in detail I'm not doing that and even if I did it would be a separate video because I I'm not doing that there's no way it's not gonna happen like have I ever responded to a content creator before I don't think so check the description I'm not going to be so petty as to say someone's opinion is wrong what am i a monster anyway this film overall has been described as divisive in that it has more detractors than any Star Wars previously including the Phantom Menace this is celebrated as a fact about its creativity when in reality it should buy the author's own metric tell them that it is the worst Star Wars to date I am NOT one to go by popular vote it is a fallacy but people who say this have to stick to their own rules of argumentation if you are happy to admit it is the most divisive and thus creative Star Wars film according to audience response then you have to conclude it is also the worst film by audience response as well be consistent please anyway Rian Johnson has come out saying the Star Wars was always going to split the fanbase if it was to stay vital and grow which alongside many of the argument methods I presented from the actual fans who loved the film such as the film is breaking down the cannon and mythos it's a new direction and of reimagining these arguments including Ryan's comments sidestep the issue at hand that you have created poor work bad work for something that does not get to have another chance something that is very important to people whether or not you care about that you had the opportunity nay the responsibility to get the band back together to have them see and feel something together again you had the actors paid and enthusiastic nobody will have that power again you had one moment in our universe in our timeline and you squandered it so as a community we were left with nowhere to go in terms of the cinematic experience we have to leave that behind now but that doesn't mean our voices won't be heard films like this are exactly why videos like mine are born and why you have now created a potential career for me that's how awful your writing is is that not insane to think about as I have said I think it's pertinent to repeat the biggest claim goes that fan theories were annihilated and thus those fans hated the movie but the reality is that those who loved the film had to theorize plots and characters to have it work they have to create fan theories in order to love the film ironic not to mention that fans used to say that episode 7 will be made better by eight and now the line is episode seven and eight will be made better by nine believe me I'm looking forward to seeing how wrong that will be and that pretty much brings us to a close people I think it's pertinent to say that with this new trilogy the makers wanted all of the benefits of the saga the characters the actors the world the assets and the fan base they wanted to play with and make money with all of it but they didn't want the responsibility of taking care of it they didn't want to have to pay any attention to what came before just superficially take what they wanted out of it and benefit from it as a whole Rian Johnson has since been trying to explain his film in multiple interviews with a collection of extremely amusing excuses for the horrible choices he is attempting to try and plug up the holes of the films he has dashed the theories that Leia was trained by Luke he has said that Snoke is definitively dead alongside Rey's parentage being truly unimportant there is no trick from kylo for those who want something more while being fans of the film that must be rough to know Ryan has an infamous quote saying that Rey and Luke are the beating heart of the film and their relationship is the core of the film can any of you remotely understand that from seeing the movie ultimately on Rian Johnson I honestly believe he's a great guy who puts the emotion before the logic every time in his films he wants to make you feel before anything else without appreciating the importance of rules within the progression of a story being told and that will often lead to the most explosive and heart wrenching events in storytelling building things in terms of rules and logic to cut directly to your emotions with a scene that not only makes sense that feels so incredibly human to watch I do want to say that yes there are actually some positives in this film I believe the visuals of this film were extremely satisfying and if Rian Johnson is responsible for them rather than his director of photography then I would hire Ryan in a heartbeat to perform that job I would heartily recommend him I would however get a legal document denying him commentary on the script whatsoever as he does not know what he's doing on top of that the more superficial aspects of the film were mostly nailed like sound design or the visual splendor the acting Adam driver the onset filming unfortunately outside of Adam and several others talent these things just come down to how much money a project has Ryan Johnson wrote Luke to have a classic fall due to hubris to fail under his own perception of himself and the monolithic collective he'd worked to sustain so you have to wonder perhaps Ryan could have learned from this lesson himself to not be such a victim of hubris as well ultimately Star Wars as a movie made people fall in love with a fictional world and its characters as a byproduct they fell in love with a brand that brand lives on today and now Star Wars as a brand is making people fall in love with the movies in a most shallow and empty way it doesn't matter what it is anymore just as long as it's called Star Wars [Music] well that didn't take long did it thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me prattle on I'm sure you're all bored to tears right now so I'll let you go but before that I wanted to talk about some more meta things for a minute or two what can you expect from my channel now well firstly I'll happily cover Star Wars in the future as I love covering a slow-motion car crash of the sequels to some of my favorite movies of all time like anyone else does I guess in that I have happily come to terms with the expectation that I should have for future Star Wars films and judging by how the Han Solo film is looking you guys can expect a similar treatment for that as I have done for the last Jedi from rage to critique though you're gonna have to be patient other than that I will be creating rage videos for my most despised films and believe me there are a lot I'm not gonna spoil the folks you'll simply see them pop up on your feed one day and hopefully it'll give you a few laughs other than that I have a few intentions with long-form content I have a bunch of projects in the pipeline that I want to cover and so you will see these things pop up alongside the rages outside of that you guys can expect a podcast from me and my friends every once in a while as well as maybe a few offhand videos on topics I want to cover now I would like to tell you folks about what you may not have seen on my channel if you got through these videos the hours and hours of analytical content then maybe you'll be more inclined to check these out once I describe them to you bear in mind that just like the Star Wars videos I am trying to make my videos for the fans of the content but I am also making sure to accommodate those who have no idea what I'm talking about my best work is easily my series comparing soma to amnesia and how the horror genre has evolved I spent just over three full time months working between jobs scouring the internet and games I'm covering to truly understand and describe what is the extremely complicated and downright masterful delivery of harrowing philosophical questions about what life is defined as and what makes us human I would wholeheartedly recommend the series however it is my first angrier series so it has swearing and insults to other youtubers that really annoyed me so viewer discretion is advised next up would be my response to h-bomb a guy in relation to Dark Souls 2 i consider this series to be my best argumentation it is literally so reese cryptid that i couldn't have done any better looking back in terms of my actual script i worked extremely hard on it for this series making sure that I not only didn't insults Harris but I responded while breaking down his arguments improving that his methods are used to trick his audience while providing evidence contrary to what he's put forth considering every last piece of evidence in the final part of that series I really think that it's pretty obvious Dark Souls 2 is an inferior game I drew a strong line between subjective and objective content in the series and it's probably my best writing so far on top of that I have several video game critiques that are rather in depth as explorations of quality I believe the most impressive one right now is outlast considering it's so huge and in depth it actually tripled in size from what I expected it to be because there's so much to talk about but there's also ukulele and Resident Evil 7 if you're interested now if you like my work you can check out one of these three to get a better taste in my channel or how I deconstruct media but if you really only want to see movie content then that's absolutely fine I would now like to thank metal mystery me for Tia and drew for checking out my videos ahead of time to help me spot the errors and fix a bunch of things that were factually wrong or just editing mistakes they make a world of difference you have no idea so thank you so at this point if you haven't left even though the analysis is over I assume you actually really do like my work and I'd like to share that I love committing to making it if you'd like to help me turn it into my career then please check out my patreon I've almost hit my first goal as of right now thanks to all of this Star Wars stuff and it's actually insane once I hit the 100 dollar mark I'm probably gonna do something nice for the channel if you like to see what I mean I post updates on my channel as well as laying out my goals clearly on my patreon page you don't have to pay to see them they're all laid out so I just want to be clear about that I treat patreon as a donation service you're not buying goods I don't want to bait you guys with rewards and Instagram photos or something I just want to keep it real donate what you feel my videos are worth to you personally and only if you feel you can afford it it is important to me that you don't feel cheated on this sort of thing since there are so many horror stories I recently rewritten my patreon to try and make all of this clear as well as what you can expect with the milestones for example I have four tiers of donation and they're literally just me saying thank you it has nothing to do with rewards at this point patreon has bought me two new pairs of glasses as I broke my old ones after a few years of use and it bought me a new chair that also broke overtime these things are why I find patreon so brilliant and on that note I would like to thank I do not want a waifu drew ear chiraq michael Steiger John Robinson Eric Malinowski Pluto Metis Ryan Stroh Maya Blade Zaki Elias Midgard Patrick Breedlove Matthew Kadish mark or L Igor Jessica Turner max McEntire Peter Maurer van Crowley Michael stopper and Sassa P with a huge thank you to the generosity of Marco kabadi Noah Williams Christopher Colin - Lee Alexander Griffith and Lydia Sparrow thanks to you guys this dream of mine is getting more and more real as the days go by I appreciate the investment you've all put into my work and I will continue to provide the best I can for all of you if you're interested in supporting me on patreon the link is in the description ok that is the end of the video this last bit is pretty much for my super fans only so shoo off people who only wanted to see Star Wars and show off the new people you need to know about the whole Dark Souls 2 series in order to understand this next bit but you can check it out if you really want to like I said it'll make so much more sense if you've seen the series first but here we go there is a channel called folding ideas the guy who runs the channel has an awesome video going over the editing in Suicide Squad and it's probably my favorite description of what is wrong with that film he found my series on h-bomb a guy and he is friends with him so naturally he did not like it but he went a step further than just saying that he said it's largely unbearable smugness presenting shallow unimaginative opinions she's honestly rough to hear from somebody you respect but then he says this I skipped to the dudes last video his own defence of Dark Souls 2 video the first two minutes are there are so many weapons to choose from so many enemies to kill and it is set before you as a will to conquer by exploration and destruction of your presumed enemies imagine being the person who plays Dark Souls 2 and comes out the other end thinking options and conquests are the appropriate for most descriptors for the game okay people who liked my series are probably aware of what is wrong here but let's go through it quickly folding ideas was skipping through my videos not watching more than a handful of minutes at a time and yet is making sweeping claims about them he said it's largely unbearable smugness presenting shallow unimaginative opinion when he hasn't even watched collectively half of a video of the 14 hour series this is so embarrassing and just genuinely rude he skipped to the beginning of the two minutes of my last video and judged it as a bad perspective on Dark Souls 2 had he waited for five minutes he would know that it was a parody I was making that abundantly clear that it was essentially a joke and he took it seriously because he didn't see the reveal just minutes later how telling is that in terms of his intentions of insulting me that he screwed it up that badly he then says that conquest and options for builds are terrible ways to describe this action RPG about clearing areas killing bosses and setting up a skill set based on what you prefer this doesn't make any sense how do you become so fundamentally wrong some other guy actually supports this this is quite possibly the worst read of Dark Souls stuff I've ever seen I'm impressed the dude is missing the point by that much what are you both talking about I talk about the themes and the story in Dark Souls 2 about four minutes after the build diversity in the video he just didn't watch that part so he assumes it doesn't exist on top of that his fan base had one consistent complaint about my videos people kept saying that the whole measured response title doesn't make sense and that 10 hours cannot be considered measured first of all measure doesn't mean short you fools and secondly it's in reference to h-bomb a guy himself his response videos are titled that way and so when I responded to him I wanted to mirror that the cherry on the cake of this utter mess is that someone responded to the criticisms of the length and said I swear there's something up with right-wing gamers and the inability to edit I'm I'm a right wing gamer now what are you talking about what did my video even cover that was remotely political I make a point to avoid that side of discussion unless absolutely necessary and yet I am right wing I have to say it was an interesting experience as I've never had a spotlight from someone that popular but they missed the mark so fundamentally that I could only read hundreds of negative comments about the work overall from people who hadn't even watched beyond five minutes and that is sad I gained about 30 subscribers from the person who shared it two folding ideas and a few new fans so that was cool and honestly to the guy who shared my video you know who you are and I want to thank you again do not feel one ounce of guilt for trying to put my videos out there it's not always gonna resonate with people but the fact is you actually try to share my perspective so I really appreciate the effort thank you but it doesn't stop there folks as time went on h-bomb a guy ignored the existence of my series but my Star Wars video came out and went viral this gave a lot of traction to my channel and so from what I can tell h-bomb a guy caught a couple of tweets about my series and so he finally gave it a full chance he watched it right the way that no he skipped through it nobody wants to watch nine hours who decide to watch random parts of it out of order because that makes more sense than watching the opening ten minutes doesn't it Harris criticized me for taking him seriously when he said people don't need lock on to play Monster Hunter do you remember that bit guys when I said that as a Monster Hunter player I could tell him that yes people wanted a lock on and it sucks that we didn't have one and now they do have one in the new game so whoops apparently that wasn't a serious argument from him apparently he was joking so I responded by saying that I treated it as a serious argument with full context because it sounded like one and whether or not it was serious it was wrong the fact that I left the quote in context means that my audience can decide for themselves from his cadence and his tone whether or not it was a joke no harm no foul ultimately Harris was rather cordial if not completely condescending at the end he tweeted out that I clearly put time and effort in and that I'm committed but I still do it badly that long-form content to this degree is not the way to go about making videos well now that I've been found by a fanbase that actually wants this kind of content I can definitively say that you're wrong Harris and I've had an overwhelming amount of support for my style of content and I think it's just what YouTube needs the problem is that everything is already truncated down and sold off each day four views would barely anyone taking the time to be clear and concise so I'm more than happy to say that I will not be taking your advice however I appreciate the sentiment versus the whole mess that folding ideas tried and failed to pull isn't it ironic that they complain about my videos being too long when they can't catch more than a few minutes out of sequence and I made a 10 minute long video they still wouldn't have gotten the point after that a fan of h-bomb a guy claimed that he was certain that I was simply mentally unhealthy to have created the series that I do not say happy or healthy mind when I will confidently claim that my series is more informative than 99% of the rubbish you see on the Internet in relation to Dark Souls as a series so you can take your armchair psychologist perspective and shove it up your arse mate and that is what happened with that I don't like pulling this cards and so you know honestly don't worry about my actual mental health here guys I tend to be a brick wall with this sort of thing but they both picked at my video and my self insulting it and ridiculing me in front of their massive audiences for misunderstanding the game being discussed and the video created encouraging others to do the same which all would have been fine with me had either of them actually watched even a 10 minute stretch of any part of the video I have to say I've lost a massive amount of respect for folding ideas his attitude is just Petty and childish as for Harris I don't expect him to respond well to 10 hours of criticism but he could have just had an easygoing chat with me about it no he'll just ignore me instead of doing what he did ultimately I offered to speak to Harris and folding ideas several times when I was denied or ignored at every turn and judging from this encounter all I can say is that I think both of them aren't interested in discussion anything that is critical of things they love or critical of themselves they're just happy to echo-chamber it right out and I suppose it's offensive to try and burst that bubble honestly if I ever get to their level of Fame I hope you guys hold me to a better standard than they fanbases hold them because this whole thing was embarrassing to read through as well as really disheartening in terms of Wow is this what Fame does to people though it would still neat to see them acknowledge my videos and a very least I gained some fans from the interaction too now that is just about the end of this saga first I want to say congratulations to those who figured out the watermelon metaphor in my rant video and that the next video to release on this channel is going to be a podcast followed by a new rage video so get hyper folks this podcast will be with two of my friends and we'll be discussing star wars as a saga if you'd like to submit a question for us to answer then simply comment with what your favorite animal is and then follow up with a question hell you can ask to if you'd like from there I will collect them and sort them into four categories the prequel trilogy the original trilogy the modern trilogy and other we will answer your questions and discuss Star Wars in general so don't forget to leave yours in the comments thank you so much for sticking through all five or so hours of this mess people I hope you have an awesome day and I we'll see you next time what a bunch of ignorant nonsense just vapid pseudo critical thinking and sophistry as evidenced by your cavalcade of cognitive distortions and informal logical fallacies straw man argument emotional reasoning special pleading non sequitur double-standard etc for starters most of your criticisms do not describe qualities unique to the last Jedi what it comes down to is this your superior expectations were not met Oh boohoo look the world's smallest violin how about you take an actual risk write a script and pitch it to Disney I mean you are the divine arbiter of all that is right and good in cinema poor little man baby needs the writer and director to explain everything to him you must really struggle with David Lynch films [Laughter] roasted me

Palpatine and so you may be asking why would kylo need the McMuffin you get there once he finds out what planet it's on from the McMuffin well Jeeves Planet X Eagle is essentially clouded in space cancer and this space cancer is so dangerous kylo Cingular ty interceptor can just narrowly make it through with a McMuffin plugged directly into his navigation though this becomes pretty irrelevant as when he arrives it clearly shows that the space cancer only represents one specific direction of approach to the planet so like couldn't anyone get here at any time from many directions as long as they know where the planet is I mean [ __ ] couldn't someone have found this by accident at this point why would they need a McMuffin once they see the space cancer just go around it you don't beat wet also I guess she really did survive episode 6 he's just a little worse for wear with white eyes and Tizen fingers but it is him Congrats dude I thought you were dead for sure in Lucas's mind Palpatine was absolutely dead after Return of the Jedi who else illy George don't you know that subjective [Music] unfortunately this [ __ ] with pretty much everything in Star Wars but I suppose we can explore that a little bit later at this point in the movie they cranked the lighting and sounds to a degree that epilepsy warnings had to be handed out they commit to this for so long that I legit couldn't [ __ ] focus on the people in the scene it's to support the creepy factor but holy hell calm down as kylo moves through we see a whole bunch of test tubes with containers that um I can't believe I'm about to say this this is real this this is a thing okay and I'm not I'm not lying to you okay as kylo moves through we see a whole bunch of test tubes and containers with botched Snoke clones I say again botched Snoke clones literally attempts at creating Supreme Leader Snoke s' implying that Emperor Palpatine can just create from scratch a hyper powerful force user from his [ __ ] bedroom in an instant Snoke has been around since before Luke had tried to murder kylo in his sleep so yeah cream Eve has been busy I mean somehow he could have made an entire army of scrotum faced hyper powerful Andy Serkis CGI [ __ ] by now he hasn't but you know precedent is there no longer does it take a lifetime of training and struggle to become the most powerful force user in the galaxy you can just poop one out of a test tube and drop him into the leading seat of the mightiest Empire clone that ever existed just like that but yeah apparently Snoke was his own dude who trained kylo well but ultimately he was created by Palpatine he's like a meat puppet maybe so like why did he even exist if it was all Palpatine anyway why not just be on the throne yourself like you already were for so long did nobody in this universe wonder where Snoke came from and if you're just gonna take over for him as soon as he dies why would you just there to begin with like I know we wondered where he came from he turned up out of nowhere and what for the people of this universe they just accepted that seriously I always thought that we just didn't know things that they did but they know as much as us was this always the plan to total surprise when about a year ago just said we're we're thinking of bringing back the Emperor how do you feel okay then what was the interaction of Snoke Luke Han and Leia did they all think that he was this real-ass guy apparently Vader's voice was faked by Palpatine as well as possibly snoke's voice in the head of kylo or [ __ ] claims as such different voice you have ever inside which is pretty awkward isn't it first we have to acknowledge that Vader just abandoned his family as a force ghost and when his grandson was being told that he should follow the dark side by a fake Vader voice Anakin just let that happen not to mention that kylos whole [ __ ] motivation was to what was it again I'll finish what you started [Music] so wouldn't finding out that the voice you've been following for years is fake shatter your entire worldview maybe it puts into question every last action you've ever taken well no not really he still absolutely intends to rule the galaxy as a darkside users so I'm going to take this opportunity to say that for the last year and a half a podcast I run with rags had a bet going with the guests the bet was to choose who you thought would be the most inconsistent character in the rise of Skywalker in reference to their past appearances now every character was on the table except Palpatine because we didn't actually know he was gonna be in the film before making this bet and I think a lot of people would have chosen him so you know it wouldn't be fair I think there's reason to assume that he wasn't going to be in this film but someone else was disqualified and that's kylo [ __ ] Ren because my god this character is so utterly inconsistent that he's become the personification of tangled up Christmas tree lights drenched in yogurt and acid I'm not even gonna pretend that he has some semblance of a through-line in these films be good be bad I don't give a [ __ ] anymore just commit you greased weasel kylo threatens to kill Palpatine and Palpatine responds you died before I don't think death means what you think it means and even if you're like a dead ghost thing inhabiting your own corpse how does your body survive exploding twice [Music] well he provides us an explanation he repeats the line we've all heard from episode three dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural and that's it that's it for the whole [ __ ] movie he just says he's alive despite having died because of the dark side thank goodness were able to bring back old enemies arbitrarily what in the world would we have done for steaks otherwise imagine they had to create a new enemy one that could bind the old and the new one that could have been pulling strings in the background from as early as a new hope one that could have had a close relationship with the character whose soul is being torn in two ways and one that isn't motivated entirely by power well [ __ ] it let's kill that guy and make him a test-tube baby created by the guy who died twice thirty years ago the absolute state of Lucasfilm just what the kylo is instructed to kill ray and become the ultimate power in the universe the manner in which pal P can make this happen is by combining his forces with the first order to create the final order remember order 66 remember the prequels because that's the point to which Disney has sunk this franchise they now desperately cling at the chance to be anywhere near as good as the prequels holy [ __ ] regardless this is the final order implying that he had this [ __ ] planned for ages and it's his endgame I wonder if there will be any comparisons to that movie in this one so Palpatine is referring to about a thousand Star Destroyers in terms of his forces not sure how he managed to get thousands of Star Destroyers made much less ones individually equipped with the ability to destroy planets seems kind of impossible on what's a desolate lightening ridden wasteland oh and during the delivery of this information the Emperor lifts all of his star destroyers out of the [ __ ] floor of ex ago with the big gay apparently these things were built below the ground and he just plowed them through his own planet to raise them up and they come fully stocked with every crew member that an enormous spacecraft would require what fresh hell is this why would you not have these things built on the surface prepped for liftoff the whole point of this place is that no one can reach it without a muffin and the first person to ultimately get here that doesn't work for Palpatine was shown them immediately they do not need to be hidden it also can't be to do with the harsh weather since they will run through the [ __ ] ground and they sit in the sky for the whole movie I don't think mr. sheave cares about their structural integrity so why would they be embedded in the floor and have people in them unless this planet is Hollow and there's a whole bunch of scaffolding and workstations below I really doubt it but let's go with that what about the integrity of the entire area what stops your weird science room from being buried there's a good reason why contractors exist you dick wrap it omelet and I'm sorry but what's gonna be the damage on these Star Destroyers because you know I'm a pretty weird dude so take this with a grain of salt but when you have your maiden voyage for a brand new ship I don't think it's good practice to plant it into the [ __ ] ground none of it makes any sense but it sure does look cool must be a JJ Abrams film anyway we flip over to Finn and Poe who are meeting with an informant that wants to provide them some info from a spy in the first order they managed to transfer the info to r2d2 and make a daring escape before it's too late this is on the ice comet by the way the glorious visual from the trailer now you might have been giving yourself the old question here of hang on what the [ __ ] is happening who was the informant who's the spy how did the first-order just find these guys so easily no we're not getting any information on that we've jumped a nebulous amount of time into the future and they're just in this situation it's a perfect setup for some action stop complaining stop asking questions I want to highlight as well that this creature tells them to win the war thanks to this information he's provided when it essentially amounts to confirmation that EXA call exists Palpatine is alive and he has a Star Destroyer fleet in the thousands because yeah they were already losing but now I'm sure this will turn the tide in their favor and actually aren't they [ __ ] how can they possibly escape the first order contract people through hyperspace and they've been found so it's too late right but then again it's a Star Destroyer that's required for that like you need a big structure and a power source or whatever like a breaker so it's it's not like Tie Fighters can do it well that's where you're wrong kiddo twice in fact Tie Fighters can now track through hyperspace to the point of it being instant almost like their travel with the person they are chasing but that's not an issue because there's a new invention in this world it's called Lightspeed skipping and Lightspeed skipping is essentially hyperspace jumping instantly several times in a row this is how PO can lose anyone who's tracking him now I didn't know that was possible nobody [ __ ] did in fact I'm pretty sure there is a very blatant line in the original trilogy that is designed to tell us that they shouldn't because it's a really quick way to die but this is a kind of no choice situation since ryan has locked JJ in with hyperspace tracking then again it was JJ's choice to have them being chased in the opening five minutes so what do I know I think it's relevant to say that it gives JJ an excuse to take us to a whole bunch of crazy places quickly he loves his visuals that JJ but it doesn't make a lot of sense does it first of all if the coordinates are random then he should be hitting the dead of space pretty much every single time considering the ratio of things vs. not things out there which means he would never have lost the TIE fighters however if these were places he actually knew about and was heading to then he was way beyond lucky to be alive he seems to appear in these places with no idea of exactly where he's gonna land do you understand how lucky he is to have landed in each of these wills with a thousand obstacles each and not hit any of them he should have been turned into whole dough soup and that leads us to the third and final location that has a random space Cthulhu worm that technically saves their lives by stopping the remaining Thai fighters that for some reason blunder ously fly into it was this intended from Poe does he know when the web moves around or was all of this just extremely lucky and how is it that he jumps almost instantly are these worlds that close together do you guys remember how long it took to get from Tatooine to Alderaan I guess none of it matters it's just stupid space stuff besides Ryan kind of ignored his own rules with the hyperspace tracker at the end of the last Jedi anyway so who really cares Finn seems to be vehement Lee against the whole idea by the way which is interesting since it's the only option they have to save their lives though Poe admits that yes this is the best they have because ray isn't on this mission just looking to clarify here ray is now better than poet piloting and he to lament the fact that she isn't there to save them in a more effective manner when it comes to piloting what can she do that wouldn't be Lightspeed skipping and would save you from the first order exactly and I mean [ __ ] piloting is like Poe's only thing but I guess he sucks at it compared to Ray because everyone sucks at everything when compared to Ray and hey if your neck hadn't already broken from the different locales characters and tones we suddenly cut to Ray she's being trained by Leia who knows how to train a Jedi now okay ray is meditating in midair while moving a whole bunch of rocks because this [ __ ] was boring I guess we gotta crank it up JJ style more rocks consistent levitation this is Ray [ __ ] she even floats down with a sigh of frustration as if the whole flying part is easy I guess Palpatine should have looked into that the problem is that she can't get them to be with her apparently she's trying to hear the voices of all the past Jedi through the gay that's just something she can meditate toward I guess regardless lair is here and she gives ray Anakin's lightsaber it's been repaired rip tlj we see a lot of running jumping and oh look the Droid that Luke used only this is Ray so we gotta crank it up she's not just blind she's not just taking many shots at once she's balancing on a thin log over a chasm [ __ ] yeah you go girl wait why does this person need training at the end of this little segment ray drops a tree on bb-8 and she's like oh no sorry and begins to push the log off which what are you doing you can literally do this just pull it off in with your God powers you irritable numpty just before Finn and Poe returned Rey is having a look-see at those sacred Jedi acts and she happens to see a page all about McMuffins yep that's what she happens to see you right before the plot kicks in with a need for McMuffins I'm sure it has absolutely no relevance as Finn and Poe get off the Falcon they meet up with Rey and we get some instant chemistry just add years of off-screen history they have this weird thing invented out of nowhere that Poe and Rey do not like each other because they have different approaches to everything it's a conflict that's presented developed and then dropped which is actually applicable to a bunch of things in this right PO is angry at Rey for not helping them as well as damaging bb-8 and Rey is mad at poe for damaging the Falcon you know damaging it while he saved his own life the lives of Chewie and fin and he secured the information because Poe's just not allowed to do things right in this saga fit even backs it up by saying that poe is always in a bad mood since when wasn't he always the fun-loving one to the test first hito first I took first fishing to jump in the next wing and blow something up hard to understand you search him I guess he got fun surgically removed during tlj like the rest of the characters go away anyway ray and finners chummy as ever they all speak as a group and the film tries it's best to pretend that they've been together for ages ray says the compressor is down and the SPO can't Lightspeed skip but then he says that he can and he did so yeah then the Falcon is fixed in about 10 minutes for the next adventure so who [ __ ] cares the conversation gets heated when Poe says that it's essentially stupid of Ray to be training to talk to past Jedi when she is the best fighter they have and they need her help to win this war she has no response to that because there is no [ __ ] response to that other than saying yeah she really shouldn't be training see I figured she would know she's the best with everything she's done and she would be helping them but she just stands there and asks about the spy there's so much to say about this interaction from a writing perspective hell I'm sure someone will do it at some point but this story really wants us to accept these folks as friends with an unbreakable bond along with values that conflict despite two of them sharing less than one minute of screen time it's so rushed speaking of which with the intelligence retrieved from the spy the resistance confirm that Palpatine is back and they all shudder gasp of course several members try to reconcile this impossibility and a Hobbit gets involved Mary suggests that it's dark science cloning and the like [Music] he describes cloning technology as secrets only the Sith knew despite there being a galactic war half of which was fought by clones but na law it's a Sith secret po goes on to say that Pal P is building the largest fleet the galaxy has ever known and it's going to attack all three worlds in 16 hours which is interesting for many reasons first if that's all you had to say in the message then why did you need this [ __ ] off transfer you could literally have shouted it to these guys or chucked them a USB with a notepad file on it would have been a hell of a lot faster than this [ __ ] for some reason to transfer like a sentence of information it takes like a minute to put it through a big floppy wire into r2d2 you can just set it to him literally like this is your r2 is a 4.1 USB connection right because that's what guy and I've got to find an adapter if he's not that thing we should have the wire is so massive as well he's alive he has a fleet of ships on this planet whatever it's cold and he's gonna attack in so many days that's that's the whole message right there I said it right spagett of written on a piece of paper excited to rock and flung it in there but in regards to the information I don't even know what free worlds are at this point did the first order take over everything or not are they going to destroy every single free-willed really they aren't going to capture them control them if this is the plan then shouldn't the free worlds be mobilizing their own attack isn't this something that the good guys should look into whether or not they have a plot to find a bunch of McMuffins and hang on wasn't Palpatine interested in having an empire not pieces of planets floating around the galaxy wasn't there actually a point to the Empire beyond killing people destroying Alderaan was a message to the rebellion this just seems to be a desire to destroy many free wills with strong resources for no other reason than be evil empire improves every system it touches safety prosperity trade opportunity peace loll no evil is on the way folks and its origin is exha goal we now have the stakes of Return of the Jedi but we're JJ's so we gotta crank it up and all of this was poofed into existence between movies because Ryan left JJ was [ __ ] nothing at the end of T LJ unfortunately however X a goal isn't on any star charts which leaves them no choice but to die we tried folks see you next time Empire wins unless someone has information on how to get to X ago like maybe a person who just read a passage in a book about it about McMuffins on an unrelated note ray talks to Leia about Luke apparently having searched facts a goal for a long time he nearly found McMuffin 3 but failed and put his notes into the sacred act for some reason he did that and then he went into exile I guess though Luke did discover somehow that you need a McMuffin to get to X ago and Luke's trail of 1 went cold in a desert somewhere and so that's where they're going to find one just just go into a desert no just an entire planetary desert ok then yeah that's a good enough lead that let's go for clarification though because you guys might not be following they want to stop the emperor's new fleet but they can't even get to it they have accepted this information as true without any confirmation because a spy in the first order told them a spy that's assumedly only been active since the events of tlj it's not like luring all of the top players of the resistance to a desert planet sounds like a trap nor does it sound like a trap to lure all of the resistance ships to one very rocky planet but ok let's trust the information the plan is this in order to get to the Emperor's fleet the book says they will need a McMuffin specifically McMuffin - because kylo has McMuffin one and there are only two McMuffins that can get a person to EXCI goal for some reason but in order to get the location to McMuffin - they will need McMuffin 3 and McMuffin 3 is apparently in this desert this is a very intelligent plan before they leave Finn makes sure to ask an old friend along shrek is back but since we're looking to repair the errors of the last Jedi in this film JJ opts to have shrek spend the story pointing at consoles and scanning things if I'm being specific however shrek says that the resistance are scanning old Star Destroyers in order to exploit weaknesses I wonder if that throwaway line will be relevant later but the important part is shrek is not coming roses like da hub it's such a move and so the adventure begins and the Falcon takes off with ease having been made lighter by the warranted removal of shrek you shall be missed by tlj fans we see our cast of characters our wonderful team happily celebrating the path they've set out upon together for the first time in this trilogy [ __ ] hell back to kylo and we see him literally repairing the damage that Rian Johnson dealt I have nothing else to say about that when I got this job I was I was just really excited to get to work without him one of the first things I thought was well we got to figure out the way to get that mask out of the way and I thought well it seems actually really natural that the idea that you know Stokes reaction to the mask is to kind of ridicule it and suddenly turn it into this symbol of his of his immaturity he's hiding behind this mask that that seems to make sense to me I love that the scene exists it fuels the hilarity of Lucasfilm and their rancid approach to what humanity used to describe a storytelling while shattering the putrid dreams of one maniac and his goal to sabotage Star Wars only to hand it off to a person that's looking to torpedo the series regardless though I think I should point out that kylo must have collected the pieces of his mask after having left it at a random elevator even after the supremacy was bifurcated he wanted it that much and he apparently picked up all of the pieces good work kylo he then walks down a corridor with the Knights of Ren what's that gentle viewer you don't know what a night of Ren is nor do you know how I managed to recognize them well we got some helpful exposition all about it they wrote that they filmed that they left that in the edit just Wow reminds me of something actually kylo establishes that there is a spy in the midst of the first order but that spy won't be able to do anything of note because they are sure to win regardless how very interesting I wonder if this spy is just an excuse for our heroes to be put on the plot in the opening and to be saved when they desperately need it later I wonder if there will be any exploration on how such a spy came to be or what his character entails anyway kylo says that they are soon to have the fleet from Mexico and nothing will stop them only for some guy to say that the ex ago people sound kind of like a cult of soothsayers why would you say that your boss is the only person who's been there and he saw a literal [ __ ] armada of Star Destroyers that they're willing to give to you who cares if their soothsayers general pride points that very information out and then the guy says well what are they asking for in return which you know what okay that's a fair question I guess let's explore that okay then kylo is throwing another temper tantrum and he strangled the guy so hard that he slapped him into the ceiling why why are you so angry for no reason all the time you querulous come in and amongst the chatter they say this Armada will make up for the failure of Starkiller base while looking at Huck's even though it was Captain phasma that allowed the shield's to go down and kylo who failed several times all over the movie including letting the droids slip out of the first orders fingers Hux literally couldn't have done anything about it when they arrived at Starkiller base if it isn't already clear they want you to understand the reasoning behind Huck's being the double agent you see it explains his consistent fuck-ups and I suppose the fact that everyone thinks he's useless and he commands no respect is having an effect there are then comments about taking more young from different areas of the galaxy this is on top of kylo saying they will crush any wills that defy them which means at this point just with this couple of sentences there is more will building than the last Jedi excellent still makes no [ __ ] sense though our heroes then arrive at not Tatooine or sorry not jakku I guess it's a new one altogether they use the specific coordinates that Luke went cold on to reach a desert the plan is to literally just sort of look around I guess this is a plot upon arriving they find that searching the desert is going to be tough considering there is a festival going on even though if that wasn't there you would still have to search a [ __ ] desert that is obviously unlucky but this festival is pretty common c-3po informs us that it takes place one spare 42 years why in the world do you write this way you absolute skunk fume but mahler it references the release of a new hope that is an explanation that is not an excuse as they approach the vast vast desert Poe explains that there's always first order patrols in these areas so you do have to be careful why would a first order patrol be here what reason would they have to be in a festival on a distant planet what I did what I'm sure it won't be relevant lucky for our heroes several wide shots show us that there's no first order in sight they will be fine as they move through this celebration looking for McMuffin 3po suggests talking to the locals as if I did I can't believe this is the plot let's go talk to the locals about McMuffin number three that Luke Skywalker couldn't find that's in this desert somewhere what a [ __ ] plan either way a Randy spots ray and gives her a necklace while asking for her family name and she stops thinking about how each movie in the sequel trilogy can't make its [ __ ] mind up on this subject but before she can give a more detailed answer kylo gives her a Skype call does it hurt they discussed the idea that kylo is closer to the light now and that Rey is closer to the dark while threatening to kill her on top of it you know the bog-standard dialogue between these two walking infections but then kylo grabs Rey's necklace and pulls it through the universe to his ship no I'm not kidding that happens we had water in tlj then we had the inviscid ice and now you can just full-on teleport objects through the universe are you aware of the applications for this what exactly are the limits can you pull her through can you pull her weapons through her clothing her friends can she pull you through and just have everyone dogpile you what is this stupid fight because kylo took the necklace Ray immediately concludes that the first order will arrive on this planet in moments and warns her friends before you can even think about that the necklace is analyzed and the specific planet is identified pushing kylo Ren to our heroes immediately and then before we can recover from that they are fleeing from the thought of being captured and a random stormtrooper is just standing here but before you can think about that the trooper is shot in the [ __ ] eye by an arrow from Lando [ __ ] Calrissian what I guess it's good to be back folks what the [ __ ] first of all how in the holy held is this random necklace design definitively mean that personna is the planet that they are on what if this was something ray got ages ago what if people who visit personna take these things to other places is this really enough to go on I love the idea that we have a scene with kylo intending to find Rey and he had absolutely no leads and then he just tall one off her neck also you might be wondering where on this planet would kylo know to search well that's because they bump into a random [ __ ] storm trooper who was just chillin there as poem n shinned in a throwaway line earlier [ __ ] sake what are the odds that they would bump into that guy at that very moment hang on does bumping into him kind of mean that the necklace didn't matter anyway you could have just said that the first order were alerted by these guys can you please keep track of your own movie how is it that kylo can get here so [ __ ] fast yes hyperspace is a thing but it's not like teleporting it still takes time even the force awakens recognizes that secondly assuming the necklace really did matter what are the [ __ ] odds that a random villager decided to put it on one of our heroes and out of the whole selection it just happened to be the one that has random Skype calls with the only guy in the [ __ ] universe that is both looking for them and has the ability to teleport items away from a person Wow thirdly how in the [ __ ] is Lando here of all the coincidences ever he's on the planet they need to go to in this plot he also happened to be in the right spot at the right time to save their lives you [ __ ] kidding me like the idea that he not only is in this right area he noticed them in general he had a weapon on him and murder is apparently cool in this culture because there's a wide shot soon after and everyone's just dancing around there is a guy who is lying dead on the floor with his eyeball slung out the back of his head and these people don't give a [ __ ] everything is so beyond lucky or is it Lando explains that Leia sent him a transmission that our heroes are on the way Lando sought Chewie and he was here previously with Luke searching for McMuffin 3 which explains why he was still on this planet we did it guys it all makes sense except it doesn't you've explained why Lando would look for them in this general festival and that he got extremely lucky and spotting Chewie considering the size of this celebration lucky like where's bloody Waldo levels of lucky you've also explained why he would have been here at some point ages ago but not why he's here now like did you just chill on this planet what about best bin you know the people you betrayed the rebellion for and why the [ __ ] didn't Leia tell our heroes about meeting Lando before they left why wouldn't he be the contact to meet on this planet that would make the most sense and save time but I guess JJ wanted to give us the shock reveal as per usual Lando explains that there are only two McMuffins that can get you to ex ago those being McMuffin one and two this planet has McMuffin three and that can lead you to McMuffin too but to get to number three you will need to get to Archie's ship it's parked over a hill somewhere somehow it hasn't been torn for parts or stolen it's just been sitting there for decades even though you can fly it with some tinkering okay also we're cooling Archie youichi Darth Chi I'm not respecting that character any more than Lucasfilm respects Star Wars so kylo Ren arrives and our heroes have to steal some speeders to evade the incoming troopers Poe Hotwire's one and Finn asks how he would know how to do that that's an interesting question you could apply so very liberally in this trilogy but here not so much he is the greatest pilot in the resistance or he was anyway why would he not know how to hotwire a speeder seems like something he could know but my mistake is not realizing that they're going to reveal some shocking history for Poe soon enough and this is the setup stay tuned folks the first order then send some troopers after our heroes and they begin to fly while chasing them my goodness I've never seen a jetpack before in this movie saga I'm sure none of them have ever seen something so unique before why wouldn't they just open with the jet packs if they're that fast it would save you a bunch of time and you're a harder target to hit and you aren't limited to a [ __ ] treaded speeder wait why are they treaded speeders as expected we get some action-packed chasing and shooting rain ailing the driving and aiming and the wonderful visuals just spill onto the screen though bb-8 happens to tap a canister and it blows up exactly as one would need it in order to [ __ ] up a trooper would have been funny if it just exploded on their speeder but hey I'm not a droid what do I know in addition Finn throws a rope with a hook on it or something and it gets tangled up in the treads of one of the troopers speeders leaving him to be blown up by a swimming PO makes for a neat action moment I guess but can someone explain why the speed is even have treads when this is the affluent first order that's riding them they are chasing people who do not use that technology how is this happening not to mention these ships apparently have shields to block laser blast but they can't bounce a rope with a hook off themselves just don't think about it eventually both of our heroes ships are blown up like one trooper just shoots the back of both of them and they all fall out of course the ships are in pieces but our team of goodies are absolutely fine because luck I guess they even managed to take several shots before finally blowing up the remaining trooper and then they promptly sink into the quicksand like the sand does nothing to them until the drama is over they're just lying on it and it does nothing until the storm trooper [ __ ] hell so they all panic as they are slowly engulfed by the sand and Ray doesn't use the gay whatsoever remember how she can float herself with ease we even see her literally move the soil at will in this very movie way later but here there's a general acceptance that she and her friends are just dead now how unfortunate that she forgot everything I hope this all works out though and I hope that it turns out falling into the quicksand is somehow exactly what they needed to do next up it turns out that falling into the quicksand was exactly what they needed to do and they discover mcmuffin number 3 it's just lying down there in a bunch of tunnels next to the corpse of Darth Chi hang on how the [ __ ] is quicksand being suspended above a series of caves how does the quicksand not go into the caves is it [ __ ] magic sand how did Luke and Lando not think to check the mysterious black quicksand just outside of Darth cheese ship when the trail went cold how didn't luke sense the evil Sith knife this was apparently their only lead to finding ex ago and they just gave up his [ __ ] ship was right there what more proof do you need to search the area also how did da Fucci die like he's a Jedi assassin right surely he's gotta have some survival instincts but they just find his bones laid out on the ground I guess he sort of gave up and the worm decided not to eat him okay so McMuffin 3 is a knife that has inscribed upon it the details of where to find McMuffin to which means our heroes can now escape and find EXA goal maybe only why in the world would the McMuffin that leads to the McMuffin that leads to the secret world be placed on a knife not a ceremonial knife mind you this dead-ass was his weapon used to kill people why don't you put on your knife and not a map you clod why would a guy who goes in and out of EXO gon need a knife with the instructions on how to find a guide 2x ago wouldn't it make more sense to hide that thing on X ago and if he needed it then wouldn't you've just had the McMuffin it leads to like isn't it better to have that than a knife that leads to that like no is because he says the other one is sitting in a room that opens automatically in the [ __ ] Death Star ruins it's not safe from scavengers that's actually proven do you leave these things there in case people want to find X ago but then anybody that Palpatine wants to get to X ago wouldn't you just send people out there to go collect them why would you leave two maps out there that someone could stumble upon randomly and look how clunky this [ __ ] knife is shad do a review of this dagger please we need it either way c-3po explains that he knows exactly what's on the knife but he can't read it out because he's not allowed to translate it to anyone else it's then handed over to c-3po who identifies the writing as a SIF language but reveals he's unable to translate the YT and due to restrictions in his programming what okay well I'm not allowed to tell me what this to clarify the issue isn't that he can't read it it's that he can't translate it into any other language and thus he cannot tell anyone else about the information so like why not have c-3po point on to a star map or whatever we know it turns out to be a place in the end or system so just do that all he can't do is turn the directions into any other language so this seems like an easy way to get around that but before they can decide on what to do next they are attacked by a sandworm or well not really they have a standoff and the whim just sort of looks at them for a while no idea why ray then notices that it's wounded and she just decides to heal it with the big guy how does she know that's possible how does she know how to do it how is this something that Anakin failed to do fish me how is this something obi-wan failed to do for qui-gon or Anakin as he arrived in pain how is it something that Luke failed to do for Anakin well maybe it doesn't quite work on humans eh maybe you can't just arbitrarily heal a fatal lightsaber stab maybe you can't heal someone from death to life because if you could it might just [ __ ] up everything upon being healed the worm [ __ ] off and by doing so accidentally knocks a bunch of rocks over and opens a pathway it's kind of like a video game how wonderfully convenient ray seems to be absolutely fine from the exchange nobody questions what just happened outside of bb-8 because apparently this is totally normal and ray explains it's all cool okay not like it should radically change your position in the resistance and in this world but yeah it's fine Chewie pockets Darth of cheese knife and they all head back to the ship to escape but Rey senses kylo and just walks away they are about to be captured they have the key to victory they have a wicking ship some [ __ ] hell and she just walks the [ __ ] away none of them stop her either she just says there's fine she wanders off the Knights of Ren are right there you have no time what is it that you plan to do assuming that kylo Ren does show up do you understand that you're currently fleeing the first order just get back to the [ __ ] ship you diuretic Thunder Wally what the hell is going she walks so far away that Chewie is sent to go and get her and in the process of doing so he is captured by the Knights of Ren yeah that just that happens look at this shot this is where she is in reference to the ship Chewie is captured on his way from the ship to here and neither Poe nor Rey no bb-8 nor finn noticed this there is no gunfire and no shouting he's even dragged off around the corner to make it sort of look like it somehow works out logistically but no one could believe that this is how everybody would be moving about and it gets worse the ship is ready to go only kylo Ren tries to run Rey over with his interceptor first of all his goal has explicitly been to turn Rey to the dark side so what the [ __ ] is he doing by trying to kill her there's a pretty big difference between trying to push someone and running them the [ __ ] over and if he really is trying to kill her then why not use the lasers you donkey but if he isn't and this is just for the memes then what would he have done if she just got splattered on the windscreen gotta go find someone else to be in the diad I suppose meanwhile Chewie is placed into a transport ready to be taken to a command ship and Finn tries to go after him Rey jumps and segments Ren's ship to the point that he crashes at like 50 miles per hour while rolling in the sand ending with an explosion don't worry he's fine that degree of g-force and an explosion can't do [ __ ] to kylo Ren not while the plot protects him anyway but I want to move away from that stupid because it's about to be dwarfed by different stupid a more potent deafening stupid and with how this works I need to tell you what happens and then I get to talk about it so here goes Rey tries to use the gay to pull the transport with a captured Chewie in it down but kylo uses gay push to counter his until Rey does this what the [ __ ] what kind of unmitigated trophy of cinematic excrement am I being forced to witness right now who's the [ __ ] carnival penis at Lucasfilm that approved this tumorous fudge we call a scene alright let's [ __ ] begin the entire team allowing ray to waddle off that far was just silly having her commit to this [ __ ] move rather than simply throwing the lightsaber from a safe position is just silly having the first order parked right next to our heroes and doing nothing about them that's just silly having Chewie go to chase ray while taking a cheese knife with him instead of leaving it with Poe and Finn that's just silly having Ray be unable to pull the ship down or just straight-up damage the thrusters is just [ __ ] silly she's a god having neither Powe nor Finn do anything about the troopers or kylo Ren all this escaping ship is just silly having kylo ren's survive being [ __ ] exploded after rolling a million miles an hour is just [ __ ] silly ray using one of the most advanced powers for the dark side without a lick of [ __ ] experience in that regard is [ __ ] silly having ray blast out concentrated gay to incinerate you [ __ ] Barker though [ __ ] really you would incipit piss waffle that series of about two minutes was just just [ __ ] silly and you know what after ray murdered Chewie Finn makes this noise and it honestly makes me laugh it's as though he's saying why the [ __ ] did you kill him you dumbass either way our characters sort of just pick up and leave no first order chase them kylo doesn't even bother trying to stop them okay next up we see Chewie is fine he's onboard kylos destroyer and it turns out rey just destroyed a random other transport ship no I'm not screwing with you this happens the film's straight up kills him and has all of the characters react and then it's just like he's fine lawl [ __ ] pond-scum script so they decide what to do about the inscription apparently there isn't enough time to return to base but there's totally enough time to visit a droid smith and work on the translation remember this I'm gonna come back to it also they are being followed by the Knights of Ren in their own ship that explains why they let them go oh wait no it doesn't why didn't they just capture them instead of letting them run free I actually have no idea during the journey bb-8 manages to power up a droid from uchi ship it just chills out and nobody wonders if it has any information that could possibly help them being that it's decades old and it's a sith droid but it's fine I mean it would be way too convenient to the story to have that be an option you know so then our heroes arrive at Kazemi and they are ambushed by Zora bliss she's an old crew member of a spice running operation Poe used to be a part of sori immediately concludes that they can collect the bounty on our heroes until Rey beats them all up and thus Zuri decides she likes Rey and ironically this is a common trait of the MarySue people in the world just like them and what [ __ ] luck that nobody was killed or even shot at in this back-and-forth and that she responded in that very specific way would have been super awkward if she didn't help them or if the first-order were alerted but hey this is how it went so zouri guides our heroes to the Droid Smith whose name is Babu Frick they take c-3po to a droid Smith named Babu Frick oh and just as our heroes are moving away the movie shows us that the Knights of Ren are right on their tail but they still lose them like this this whole group of them moving in lockstep throughout the city searching for these people that they let go despite knowing exactly where the ship is and yet they are all searching everything one one together and they lost them you guys are so incompetent that I'm starting to think you didn't make it to the last Jedi because you just got lost mr. Frick then concludes that you have to erase c-3po s memory in order to successfully translate the SIF message why why does that follow in any way whatsoever why would you have to erase his whole memory that that's just what in fact why can't you have do translated he's literally a SIF droid c-3po then says that r2d2 doesn't have reliable copies of c-3po s memory and that this is their only shot meaning that if they were to return to base after the mission where r2d2 is just chilling out c-3po would not be able to be restored meaning this is now c-3po s death scene why the [ __ ] would a goddamn droid Smith not have any way to create a backup for a droid I was like an IT tech not having a USB for [ __ ] sake and do I even need to talk about how utterly embarrassing it is that you have c-3po essentially dying with nobody he [ __ ] knows in the room Leia Chewie and r2d2 are all gone four equally [ __ ] reasons and you have this saga long character tell the audience that he's saying goodbye to his friends and he's speaking to people that he maybe [ __ ] a [ __ ] minute of screentime with yeah I'm not [ __ ] buying that so c-3po dies great moving on Zhora bliss shares that she has a first-order captain's medallion which means you get free passage through any blockade what [ __ ] luck that she just has a magical space coin that can basically push anybody through the plot kinda seems as though it makes no sense being that whichever captain to belong to would surely know it's missing and get it deactivated not to mention that if this theoretical captain were dead it would surely have been decommissioned but alright I guess that's how that works I mean it's no big deal she's not giving it to Poe and the rest of our heroes or anything it's meant for her so she can finally escape this planet that she's been trapped on for so long a planet filled with pain that she wants to get away from this is her only shot anyway she ends up giving it to Poe and they use it to ambush a first-order ship and save Chewie [ __ ] this gelatinous plumb of a script PO then shares that nobody came to help the resistance in their final hours on crate he thinks that everyone is too scared and Zora counters by saying there's more of us than them and they win when they make us feel alone maybe in sheer number you might be right but you are aware of the absolute Legion of death star destroyers right like standing up to them could mean the destruction of your entire solar system my favorite line they win because they make us feel alone yeah no they win because of their galaxy destroying lasers seems like a detail that might keep this army from forming but yeah it's a coincidence thing for sure so our heroes are directed to the Endor system for McMuffin to buy a now blank c-3po kylo Ren arrives he was a bit slower this time despite having his Knights directly behind our heroes compared to being systems away with naught but a [ __ ] necklace but who cares astronomy is gay when seeing wrens ship Rey manages to sense that Chewbacca is alive and they decide to go and rescue him with the space coin allowing them to land their ship why is it that Rey couldn't sense that he was alive when he was about thirty meters away from her when she thought she'd killed him no [ __ ] clue I guess the plot didn't care at that point I don't even know where to begin with stuff like this nothing runs with any cause-and-effect bliss just has this thing that lets them get through first-order blockades and she just gives it to them ray just senses Chewie with the gay they have the weight of the universe on their shoulders and they immediately decide to go into the belly of the beast to get Chewie out they don't even take the space coin with them either they leave it on the ship that thing was specifically invented to make it so that Chewie could be saved and the dagger could be retrieved and nothing gets discussed by these characters they do not give a [ __ ] the journey is already decided did I mention the pacing is horrific in this film also I find it hilarious that Rey is happy she didn't kill Chewie and that we're all good to go now but who knows who she actually did kill on that transport or whether they were prisoners on it you [ __ ] psychopath so kylo goes searching for Rey in the city while our heroes enter the Star Destroyer to save Chewie apparently the Knights have so little clue as to where any of them are they have to search the entire city again that's the dialogue one for one well done lads so you're telling me that they actually managed to land this ship inside the Star Destroyer because of a space coin are you certain that this wouldn't have tripped several alarms ah well that's where you're wrong they actually send two stormtroopers to go and check oh wow you just murdered them right in front of the entire hangar bay I feel like you guys are [ __ ] now I can't help but think of another scene that they did this in where it was much more meticulous and well reasoned in terms of how they actually managed to get past these systems but here they just run through shoot everybody good stuff guys moving on upon delving further into the ship race splits off from poe and finn to go and find McMuffin 3 let me repeat that rey splits off from them to go and find McMuffin three McMuffin 3 if you remember is the knife the knife had a guide to McMuffin - and they have that translated now from c-3po so why would they as characters have any reason to go and get the knife why would they split up the team when they're supposed to be finding Chewie well unbeknownst to our entire team it's actually very important that they get that knife let's have a look at what ray tells Poe as a reason for why she's leaving them why feeling a feeling a [ __ ] feeling that you need it you are going to risk everyone's lives over a feeling my goodness also just before that she does a mind trick on two stormtroopers at once to get the info about Chewie and tells everybody to shoot out the cameras I imagine this is in hopes that they don't alert the first-order as to where they are though I am almost certain that shooting cameras will alert [ __ ] everybody to exactly where you are it's also neat that she's just this good with the force I guess though that is downright consistent at this point anyway general pride spots this ship in the hangar bay personally don't know why he was heading there don't know why he was essentially doing the work of the lowest ranks imaginable but yeah that just happens he immediately questions who it belongs to which makes me wonder how the [ __ ] a space coin can get you through any blockades if it's provably false as a ship by looks alone how far can the coin possibly get you do you not need to confirm with any kind of code or communication beyond a [ __ ] metal chip this being noticed leads to Finn and Poe having to gun down around twenty to thirty stormtroopers they just stand there and get shot it's honestly just sad there's even a moment where a couple of troopers turn up behind our heroes choose not to shoot them and then they wait to get shot instead the first order looking super competent as usual either way they end up getting captured along with Chewie and sent for execution Poe is shot by the way but it's in the arm and everyone forgets about it in seconds more on that in a moment so Rey actually manages to find the dagger Chuy's bandolier and his bow caster because she could sense the gay that totally makes sense I guess Luke really couldn't sense the knife when he was at persona but she can sense it here I like how they aren't even locked down either this is the knife that allows a person to find Palpatine secret mcmuffin that leads to his hidden army and it's just sitting on some white block along with Chewbacca's [ __ ] bandolier what the [ __ ] is this before she can leave kylo calls her on skype again because he of course wants to find her even though he could have just captured her moments ago god this is such a headache you would think he would just keep Skype open at all times or at least do it a bit more considering how much he needs to find her but nope he spends this discussion looking for a clue as to her location and unfortunately for Rey they have a small battle that involves knocking over Darth Vader's helmet teleporting it to kylo and so kylo knows exactly where she is the sheer luck factor in every element of this script is beyond insane it hurts to [ __ ] think about but yeah with how the teleporting works I guess Darth Vader's helmet is now just sitting in the middle of koji me cool though the amusing thing is they make something like that happen on purpose to push the plot like the helmet itself being teleported through when they didn't even need to Rey was already holding the [ __ ] Sith dagger when he opened up the call with her she has it in her hand throughout the [ __ ] conversation how does that not tell kylo exactly where she is that thick [ __ ] though I suppose the more interesting part of this scene is that of kylo Ren telling Rey about her lineage her parents were indeed nobody but there's more to that story we're gonna get there but I want to say ahead of time Rian Johnson must have [ __ ] hated watching this movie it pisses all over the last Jedi and as much as that amuses me it's not exactly great to look at you know segmented piles of hot rotting excrement pouring over a dilapidated corpse that once used to be quite something I'm not exactly happy about the extra mint but I can laugh at it ray tells c-3po bb-8 and do the new droid to go and find poe and finn she doesn't suggest how they can escape she simply says they should go well okay but before we can even think about how Rey imagines they'll escape you have to wonder how it's possible for these droids to simply find the others maybe they're gonna do a scan like they did in a new hope or maybe they have some comms nope we have a scene where c-3po walks down a corridor and suddenly what [ __ ] luck they're just around the [ __ ] corner this is just wonderful new piece of [ __ ] crotch brained [ __ ] bucket of an excuse for a script okay so Huck's prevents the execution of Po Finn and Chuy explaining that he's the spy and that he betrayed the first order because he doesn't like kylo Ren that's it he just hates him and wants him to go away we have no idea how long he's been a spy we have no idea if there's anything to him that's altruistic he just seems as though he very much doesn't like kylo Ren and that's worth losing his entire career his faction and risking his life he stops the lockdown for them and asks that Finn shoot him to make him look like he was forced to let them go despite the fact that they took the time to explain that there are cameras everywhere you [ __ ] idiots not to mention by the way that when they captured Chewie they wanted to torture him which they didn't manage to get started apparently but when they capture Poe Finn and Chewie they decide to execute them immediately I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that they were being executed by the one person who could save them it's almost like luck is a very big factor in this script moving on kylo meets up with Rey in the hangar bay and explains that Palpatine is her grandfather and yeah her parents were nobody but who [ __ ] cares her grandfather was god damn emperor [ __ ] palps creamy sheave himself which would naturally mean that one of her parents was the child of Emperor Palpatine who or repellent they were nobody had filthy junk treasures nothing never what do you mean you didn't like i lo that doesn't make any sense what if her parents was the child of Emperor Palpatine mr. Johnson I'm so sorry but I can't stop laughing at how much JJ must have hated your movie apparently Rey's parents kept her hidden from Palpatine because they didn't want her to become an evil tizen and he's been searching for her ever since but what helps didn't know is that there was a dyad in the gay two that are one and so kylo suggests that she joined him and killed Palpatine because the dyad can overpower creamy sheave himself but before any decision can be made for sure Finn and Poe collect Rey and escape via hyperspace they don't use the skip this time though they just leave with the one so why don't they get followed how literally says what why okay we didn't get the answer for why they let you go earlier despite immediately choosing to have them executed when they were captured and we're not gonna get the answer for why they let you go now are we even though the first order have now lost the dagger as a result it's almost as if [ __ ] nothing makes any sense cutting back Hux explains that he was forced to let them go and general pride played dashingly by the wonderful Richard II grant just straight up kills him I cannot help but believe that JJ was so pissed that Ryan turned his young Empire enthusiast general Mann into a clown that he decided to create a new character that behave just like Huck's from the force awakens and have him execute what remained of the character that he was supposed to be and that Ryan shat on how you doin there Ryan okay buddy it's also pretty interesting that they discover the spy for the resistance the proverbial thorn in the first order side and they choose to execute him no interrogation not even a question he would theoretically have a wealth of knowledge on the enemy but [ __ ] it that would make sense next up we get racing that Palpatine killed her parents so she will destroy him and Finn says I know you and that doesn't sound like you only for Rey to say films trying to be like oh [ __ ] Ray's got a dark streak to her what's gonna happen oh my god and all I can help but say is the [ __ ] when does she ever make any decision that's even remotely dubious remember when Luke strangled the guards at Jabba's or how he demanded job and kneel to his demands or die remember how Anakin executed the Tusken Raiders when does Rey literally do anything that could be considered the dark gay was it the lightning I don't think she even knew how to do that and it's clearly not tied to him motives as a person because she only thought she was saving someone in that moment oh dear they'll be essays written about how much you can't say about Rey and side note during this journey poe is dealing with a blaster shot to the arm and since he's the most talented pilot in the resistance outside of Jesus over here he's quite important not to mention that he's second in command after Leia you'd think that Rey could maybe lend him a hand and heal that up for him since you know she'll do it with a wild [ __ ] animal but nope he can just have a bandage let's just hope it doesn't affect his piloting anyway we managed to visit kylo for a moment and Palpatine tells him that he still needs to kill ray there's no hologram they just have Palpatine tell him this in his head through the force that's just a casual thing now okay so now we end up in the end or system where mcmuffin 3 says McMuffin to is and that just so happens to be the broken remains of the second Death Star yes this Death Star how could this possibly work even if there were pieces of this thing how could it land it would have burnt up in the atmosphere it would have made an enormous crater but if those things didn't happen then surely it would have just crumbled regardless how could it possibly be in this kind of condition and how the hell didn't it actually fall on the same moon of Endor from Episode six how did it manage to get to this place oh my god it's also terrible so ray is asked what it is and she uh nayana Klee says it's a bad place a bad place it's a bad place so like are we still gonna pretend that the prequels are the only ones with shitty dialogue now you may be asking if McMuffin too is in only one room on this destroy Death Star then how could they possibly find the right room it's surely impossible to search the whole thing with the time they have so they're [ __ ] right well ray pulls out a ruler portion of the blade yes just go with me here and she lines it up with the ruins of the Death Star to point to the exact place she needs to go do you understand the sheer insanity of this [ __ ] moment can i express to you how [ __ ] stupid this is you have to have carved the knife from before ray was a child so like 20 years ago and you had to do it based on the ruins of the enormous fallen ship and then you create a ruler attachment that extends out and points to the correct room based on where you were standing at the time are you [ __ ] baiting me not only do you have to worry about the ruins shifting over decades which is pretty likely of an enormous fall and death star that's in the [ __ ] ocean for Christ's sake not only do you have to rely on the idea that the resistance rebellion or just Randy's in general decide to never plunder this place despite having insanely valuable resources within it not only do you have to worry about ray figuring out that this is the thing you even need to do with this knife not only do you have to be in the right distance away for it to line up with the blade but you also have to be at this specific angle if they had looked at this Death Star from any other position they would have been [ __ ] out of luck what the [ __ ] is happening who wrote this who would want this attached to the [ __ ] resume holy mother of Hades you galactic [ __ ] with this information they can go and get McMuffin too but the locals tell our heroes that they have to wait till morning because of the enormous waves that are preventing travel for now they can't take the Falcon over there because the landing gear is all [ __ ] apparently um the Falcon can float just have it drop off Rey and Finn or whatever like why wait an entire day when the first order know where you are it's not like the Falcons never been damaged before you do realize that the Galaxy is depending on you right now yeah why are you people so beyond stupid this isn't even a contrivance anymore it's just sludge insidious sludge dripping onto the page either way they all agree to wait only for Rey to run off and go alone again for reasons like I don't know why she did this she behaves very oddly in this movie she also manages to pilot the watercraft there despite the fact that the people who probably know exactly how they work told her not to because it's gonna be too difficult [ __ ] desert bound hermit is so talented that she can sail the choppy ax stuff seas can we even pretend to be surprised anymore you know what why doesn't she just [ __ ] fly over there we know she can why not teleport why not anything at this [ __ ] point so fit on the locals decide to follow her in another skimmer because apparently we can just do that now I thought they made a big deal about not doing it but what the [ __ ] ever also I have no idea what Poe is gonna do about all this he doesn't come with them and no one seems to tell him we just see him again back at the base later so ya don't know what's going on there raised then seem traversing the dangerous remains for the Death Star just like she did back on Jack who with Star Destroyers but it makes no sense anymore she can literally just float with ease she can also jump incredible Heights why is she making a big deal about a little gap like this anyway she gets to the Emperor's throne room because Star Wars and she enters sheaves bedroom where he kept McMuffin number two as she goes to leave she is attacked by evil ray remember her well she tries to speak to Rey and before you can absorb that she shows Rey her scary Bilbo teeth and Rey falls over JJ what the [ __ ] am I looking at kylo then picks up McMuffin too because he's just here now and he destroys it whoops now they have to fight and fight they do it's awful please go and subscribe to shadow versity so that we can see him break down exactly why when the blu-ray version comes out for this horrible mess link is in the description anyway we cut to layer at the base Maz Kanata explains to everyone that she has to use the Skype power to see kylo and that it will kill her I guess Leia figured that she could stop kylo from killing Rey I don't know how she knows that's gonna happen i sees the future I don't know like how she know about any of this huh has the gay become like the most convenient thing that's ever existed now it's just pure convenient magic like I know a lot of people say I never had rules it had rules you [ __ ] it had a lot of rules you know I'd like to develop what I was kind of talking about earlier how did kylo know that she was in the Death Star how did he know where to park he didn't see the info from a cheese knife but him being there means the first order had to know where the heroes we're and followed them through hyperspace right so how come the people fixing the Falcon aren't dead now how aren't they at the very least captured Rey isn't even on it and she's the only person Kyla once alive everybody who's on the Falcon was going to be executed like 10 minutes ago are we gonna get answers as to how any of this works no okay kylo and Rey continue to battle and kylo essentially wins I have no idea how considering he was beaten by her twice without training but I guess that gut shot really mattered sometimes anyway when kylo is about to deliver the killing blow he sees Leia and drops his weapon once that happens race straight up cheap shots in with a sucker stab to the chest and then is immediately like oh no lei is dead which is wait what the [ __ ] lei is dead now you went to this amount of effort to bring her into this film only to have it go out like that a [ __ ] silhouette falling over oh that's three for three folks all of them [ __ ] annihilated by the sequels so ray feels guilty immediately because what she did was concentrated [ __ ] and so she heals kylo with the gay and tells him she wanted to take his hand but specifically bends Han and not exactly sure of what that means other than please be good now you [ __ ] idiots either way she runs off apparently kylos ship was right next to where they ended their battle it doesn't require any keys or ID to fly and of course ray knows how to fly it and it just happens to be right there meanwhile Finn and Poe go back to base they have no idea if Raven found the McMuffin or where to look for it since she took the dagger she didn't tell them fuchal even though their whole bloody job was to find a way to exit all and so they head home and not to skip ahead but this is never addressed they never actually ask you why the hell she randomly abandoned them but hey they once or whatever like as it stands at this very moment in the film the entire journey for Chewie Poe and Finn was pointless anyway kylo is standing up now and he's visited by a certain someone han [ __ ] solo and the film makes sure to tell us that this is exclusively from Kyla's memory not a force ghost could you imagine how [ __ ] that [ __ ] would be regardless Han forgives kylo which is pretty [ __ ] meaningless when you think about it like he admits this is his own memory and then he has his own memory forgive himself han is dead he didn't forgive you you forgave yourself and with everything you've done across these three movies that hasn't been earned whatsoever anyway kylo decides to throw his lightsaber into the ocean and have a look around he's alone there so I'm not sure what his plan is but I'm sure we'll find out eventually next up we see that pride is having a discussion with Palpatine and they decide to combine their forces at exag all for no reason while sending a ship to destroy koji me why would they place all of their ships in a single position outside of one from EXA goal and random ones in the first order I thought the conditions on X ago were like terrible well we need a finale so why not also why destroy Kojima well because they want to piss off the resistance yeah but why as we were about to find out you are very vulnerable at EXA goal why are you trying to get people to attack you they're also zouri blisses ohnkoji me and she didn't have his space coin because she gave it away so I guess she's dead now rip how exactly does Palpatine think Ray's gonna get 2x a goal considering she's currently on October 9 kylo ship and swearing off any in Almond at all does he hope that Luke will convince her to we then see the final order begin as the plan to blow up kojima is enacted with a death star destroyer look at stupid those dudes in red of black look [ __ ] red ass troopers huh anyway the rebellion catch up to this event and conclude that every single ship in the Emperor's fleet has planet killing weapons and they've sent out a signal that all planets must submit or die well I'll tell you one thing the Emperor's death star is looking pretty puny now you nailed it JJ we have 1000 super mobile death stars good [ __ ] that's how steaks get amped up I love it so anyway on arc to Ray goes to throw Anakin's lightsaber into the [ __ ] bonfire and before it can fall in jake skywalker catches it oh well i guess we're still doing that huh ghosts can just interact however they want that's just wonderful is there any explanation for that just do this why would it be that planet when Luke went there specifically to cut himself off from the force why would he go to the planet that super 4 see where ghost can even use the Force if he wanted to escape the force it may not be the digit I originate there but that's where they established their first it's not how that works you just won the Jedi said this is the first temple it would boom and force ghost him and I have power there it's like that's what my works well yeah cuz obi-wan died on the Death Star but he showed up on Dagobah and well yeah but then Luke showed up at a scene you know you can go anywhere as a force ghost so you should go to X goal and summon lightning and destroy the fleet yeah this is why I joked about it before but I guess say it again what's the point of being alive look either way you would think that Jake would be okay with nuking that light say but considering how much of a [ __ ] he gave about it before but he does have something interesting to say about that [Music] wait I'm sorry one more time [Music] get [ __ ] Ryan oh my god what a rollercoaster it's been to be a fan of Star Wars holy [ __ ] Luke then says that she shouldn't stay on this island and of course she replies that he did and Luke then says coming to the island was a mistake JJ stop please I cut this can't be real this is the cinematic equivalent of two babies fighting over which ones toys get to be in the [ __ ] sandbox only the sandbox cost four billion dollars to [ __ ] buy so Luke tells you to go fight Palpatine because she's not evil which is sound advice I guess hope nothing bad can come of that he also provides Sarah's second lightsaber this one is layers from when she was training with Luke Luke kept it on the island because Leia didn't want it apparently Leia was scared that if she kept being a Jedi her son would die because she saw it in a vision so she decided that Luke should take care of her lightsaber for a person who would eventually pick it up and finish Leia's journey on ironically this is what Luke says Leia gave it up because she saw his son's death at the end of her journey and so she wanted someone else to finish her journey thus killing her son what the [ __ ] is this writing also Luke says he knew Rey was a Palpatine but didn't want to say anything didn't he like swear off teaching people to control the gay because of what happened with kylo and yet he decided to try with a [ __ ] Palpatine really why was he shocked when she went for the dark gay in tlj you know I think these movies don't like each other so then Luke raises his old x-wing out of the water meaning he truly committed suicide rather than turning up to create himself awesome thanks for that Rey then uses that and kylos mcmuffin to approach EXA call all the people who said Luke couldn't get to create with his ship because it was waterlogged how does it feel to have JJ just spit in your coffee and slap you in the face yeah that's how tlj felt also force ghost can just do [ __ ] anything at this point that normal Jedi can do wonderful also also Luke had to let Rey know about the McMuffin in Kyle ship apparently she didn't notice that thing being plugged into a navigation despite knowing exactly what a McMuffin looks like so she didn't transmit the information to her friends because she's an [ __ ] or because she's absurdly forgetful you can take your pic on that oh and if your brain hadn't melted already r2d2 casually reinstalls c-3po he's fine now back to normal in fact what do you guys mean that they made a big deal out of it what's wrong with this bait and switch all talented writers use it they did it with Chewie they did it with Palpatine and we haven't even finished this movie yet I wonder who else is gonna come back to life so back with the rebellion everything was a waste of time and they have no idea what to do do the random droid the belongs to da fook II happens to have a readout of EXA goal on his hard drive they get the location of the planet the fleet and how dangerous the surrounding area is as well as the core weaknesses they can exploit how about there he functions as what they thought they wanted out of the McMuffin how [ __ ] lucky but of course as they learn you need the McMuffin to be plugged into your navigation in order to get past the space cancer unless Rey is moving through the space cancer right now and she can just transmit the coordinates that you would have gotten through plugging in the McMuffin wow you can just do that that sounds so lucky woohoo and so the rebellion fleet follow her to EXA goal she doesn't wait for them and they don't wait for backup because yeah what a useful [ __ ] droid to have come across what wonderful [ __ ] [ __ ] this whole plot has been imagine for a moment that Ray had sent that guide to the space cancer and they didn't have do in order to know where X a goal even was which by the way is exactly what she should assume they have in terms of information because the discovery from do comes after Ray has left our team of heroes and she's supposed to be the only one with a functioning McMuffin unless of course transmitting the info makes it so that do is essentially obsolete in which case why have it that they get all this information from do anyway oh my god who wrote this and it's about to get so much worse ladies and gentlemen I present to you JJ Abrams trying to make a high-stakes final battle scene so we have like a thousand Star Destroyers on X Eagle versus a flimsy fleet from the resistance that sounds like we lose but there's a key factor they have no shields on ex-girl and po makes it clear that the reason for that is you cannot activate shields until you are above atmosphere that is something that PO says I didn't know that that was [ __ ] true but apparently that's a rule now even though the troopers had shields on their tread speeders in personna even though the war at the beginning of the fifth movie began with the empire trying to destroy a shield generator that was protecting a base in the atmosphere of a planet and even with that insanity we haven't won yet what would stop the Death Star Destroyers from just going up above the atmosphere they'll get their shields back and there's still like a thousand of them well po has an answer for that it's that size need help taking off now if can't tell which way is up out there navcon tell which way is up out there are you [ __ ] yanking my chain the ships can't tell which way is up [ __ ] up how about you look out the [ __ ] window you turbo [ __ ] how the [ __ ] would they not be able to tell how to go [ __ ] up if you guys can tell which way is up then surely they [ __ ] can they have windows you just need to go in the opposite direction of gravity can we please get a helium balloon for each Star Destroyer in case our pilots can't look outside also are you telling me that they don't have any Star Destroyers in space right now they don't have one here or here or here what the [ __ ] are you talking about po oh god it gets worse apparently the star destroyers need to have a tower to tell them how to go up if our heroes destroy said tower all of the ships are [ __ ] and all you have to do is shoot the under side cannon for the entire ship to explode that's the plan it's as simple as that are you [ __ ] kidding me all because they don't know how to go up what the [ __ ] Mary then asks whether they can do a whole doe maneuver they named it after her holy [ __ ] but Finn replies come on that move is one in a million one in a million one in a million you're telling me that what she did had a one in a million chance of working she was just astronomically lucky what do you [ __ ] mean doesn't that make her a traitor now if it was a 999,999 chance out of a million that she would escape into hyperspace then isn't that the obvious [ __ ] thing she was trying to do and she got unlucky according to this movie Admiral hold oh is a [ __ ] coward and what's more as she failed at running away also by her own judgement she's now at wet remember this you have bet the survival of the resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk I was one in a million you stuck up from be sack of rats honestly though how the [ __ ] could it possibly be one in a million how do you miss the supremacy when it's that enormous and if she knew that it was a low chance then why didn't she just drive the ship into them the regular way once again JJ kicks Ryan right in the balls though in fairness Ryan kind of earned it when he kicked the rest of Star Wars in the balls with that stupid scene though I do want to say that this is exactly what we were all expecting Ryan Johnson wrote it so that stakes couldn't exist in space battles anymore without some kind of retcon and JJ Abrams just retconned it into oblivion what a [ __ ] show they still don't have a lot of access to reinforcements so the plan is to send Chewie and Lando to the core systems and ask for help kind of like they did in the last Jedi only during that film they actually had better odds they weren't fighting thousands of planet destroying Star Destroyers and they had an actual escape but sure fine may as well try kicking on ray gets to EXCI goal and she makes her way to Palpatine she also arrives while wearing Luke's x-wing helmet which we see the good guys traveling through the space cancer and it's kind of insane we're getting a [ __ ] ton of huge ships just moving through something that a Thai interceptor had to dodge and weave through but alright it's only about 20 ships I'm sure I can believe that as soon as the fleet arrive they are bombarded with what seems to be thousands of lasers and they make it out okay for a while I don't know that that's possible in fact I think it's very not possible at all actually but okay so we find out that the tower is just sitting on the surface of X ago not protected by anything and of course it doesn't have any shields because those aren't possible below atmosphere the plan is to send a ground crew to go and disable it but why not just fire a missile at it though or like even lasers like just fly one dude there this all you need is one guy it has no shields you can't I still can't believe this entire plan comes from a random droid they found on a 20 year old ship in the [ __ ] desert kill me general pride then discovers their plan and so he reroute the ship's navigation to his own ship to guide them out way what he can literally guide out the ships with his own ship because I'd like the other ships he knows how to fly it's Christmas why wouldn't you build all of the Star Destroyers to have the tower installed you [ __ ] hab so the rebels spot this plan by seeing the navigation tower deactivate they don't shoot it mind you they simply spot it deactivating Finn quickly realizes that it's Prydz ship that has the new source of the navigation and so they concoct a plan to assault his ship and destroy the navigational portion of it though whatever how does he know that pride ship has the navigational source well he explains it for us he has a feeling a [ __ ] feeling fantastic they land their transport on pride ship and they intend to travel to the tower and destroy it they can't do it with speeders because pride can Jam those apparently like he just says to jam the speeders I didn't know that was a thing and that wouldn't have worked if they just parked closer to the tower anyway but okay the subordinate then says and that's because they are riding space horses to the goal why would you park so far away from your goal it seems the only reason is to literally have this moment with the space horses so yeah they ride them on a Star Destroyer and for some reason pride is bewildered by this he has no idea how to stop it try tilting the ship they have horses you pancake [ __ ] you have artificial gravity they don't tilt the ship and even if the gravity somehow applies to them outside of the ship it is worth tossing your crew around if it means saving your entire fleet for [ __ ] sake how is do you this [ __ ] stupid their horses you've outclassed them in technology by seven all thousand [ __ ] years get your act together for [ __ ] sake we then see them all get attacked by Sith troopers because why not with the amount that land it's over there's no way they don't wash over the very small number of rebels as is but oh my god shrek is here yes shrek made it into the seed good for you so Finn and the other person make their way to the tower and a person I honestly don't remember her name shoots an enemy with an arrow and destroys it okay then she drops grenades into a hole and it blows up prides navigation tower which means the navigation is now [ __ ] and all the rebels have to do is destroy the ships because the ships can't escape XO goal because they don't know which way is up pride is sad to discover this and demands that they reset the Death Star Destroyer systems in order to regain navigation how do you reset your systems when the [ __ ] navigation tower has been destroyed you dopey [ __ ] holster Finn realizes that this is Prydz plan and so he decides that they have to blow up the entire ship whether or not he's gonna make it back come the final order or whatever just reactivate the first tower now why are they trying to reset their own tower instead of just flipping the one on the bottom back on doesn't that kind of destroy any and all tension this [ __ ] battle even had so Finn tell Shrek to leave and begins his sacrifice again only this time shrek can't stop him and it's played as an absolutely heroic move once again just JJ [ __ ] all over Rian Johnson and I can't help but [ __ ] laugh back over to Rey and she meets up with Palpatine he explains to her that she needs to kill him so that he can possess her with all of the Sith that ever existed and become super evil Sith God person I guess you'd think he would have tried that with Luke or Vader in Return of the Jedi but obviously he hadn't learned that ability yet while in this scene by the way there's this weird [ __ ] audience of what appear to be thousands chanting for Palpatine like in cities and [ __ ] who the [ __ ] are these people are they Sith where I come from where they sleep do they have like a 9 til 5 job wait wait what do they eat is it's no clones do they have a Snoke soup with a side of Snoke either way kylo arrives to I guess he had to awkwardly explain to his team that he's not with them but he still needs a ride all he got it from the ruined Death Star but that just raises even more questions they then have this slapstick moment where he jumps onto a chain to get down to Palpatine and Rey but he hits himself and says ow really feeling the tone here from there kylo shoots some randoms and finally bumps into the Knights of Ren these guys are super formidable with their clubs and axes I mean they're essentially [ __ ] kylo has a blaster and the force what can they possibly do well the thing is when we cut back to kylo he doesn't have the blaster it's just gone ladies and gentlemen JJ Abrams has actually continued something from Ryan's work the disappearing weapon and of course without the blaster kylo loses immediately probably should have held on to it with a bit more passion or hell could have brought your [ __ ] lightsaber couldn't you despite all of this nonsense Rey provides kylo a lightsaber through skype teleport and he manages to kill all of the Knights they even have him do a han Solo shrug which makes no sense for him as a character kylo Ren has about as much humor as a dead sock you know I haven't talked about it that much but the fighting really has been Tisza me in this film like there's this moment where kylo turns his back on the knights of ren with his lightsaber behind him and he just sort of waits for them to hit it and then they do and then he's like satisfied with that why would they still hit it why wouldn't they just attack him where he's vulnerable oh and let's not forget the stab his way into after Rey and kylo kill all of the minions in the area they meet up and prepare to take down Palpatine once and for all which is confusing because I thought Palpatine said if you kill him he just becomes you or whatever so III don't know what their plan is here either way old creamy sheave just obliterates them he immediately sucks the life energy from both their bodies because that's something he can just do and they can't do anything to stop him and now he becomes super sheave these two were essentially gods in the force and he just sucks their shoots dry oh well hope he'll pee even got his SIF eyes back for Sabri what has happened to get Ybor discount Porkins dies he like gets shot down does anyone remember him he was in TFA I just I don't really remember him because Ryan forgot to carry him over to tlj so now he's dead rip anyway all seems lost and everyone is panicking but good fortune is just around the corner as is the case whenever a fight scene seems dire pokey is on his comms a familiar voice a voice that tells him backup is on the way oh sorry that's the wrong clip at that moment thousands of ships blast into EXO call all allies all prepared to help save the day oh sorry wrong clip actually how the [ __ ] did this many ships manage to navigate the space cancer look at that crowd how in the world could that be possible they should have been [ __ ] obliterated unless they took my plan seriously and finally just went around the space cancer for [ __ ] sake also why the [ __ ] didn't they wait for Lando to come back with a message from the other systems before assaulting exid all alone it was only like an hour at most as a result he's gotten the majority of his team killed ahead of time thanks to his hotheadedness wasn't he supposed to learn his lesson in tlj that you know you make the right decision and then you get punished and now he's making the wrong decisions and not being punished kind of like the end of that film - among the ships we find zouri bliss she's not dead and neither is Babu Frick why is no one staying dead in this [ __ ] movie it's just this little person making this stupid shouts out at a ship with a person whose whole planet was destroyed with no feasible way for her to escape Chuy's c-3po Babu Frick Zora bliss Palpatine everyone just dies and comes back a cart with this also if this many people are willing to come when all hope was essentially lost then they must have been creating a resistance themselves right how was this Armada ready to go that around was [ __ ] minutes holy Moses okay so they assault the Death Star Destroyer army and they begin to turn the tide they even show a y-wing utterly [ __ ] up a Death Star Destroyer those people do not know what a y-wing is shut the [ __ ] up I'm pretty sure this moment is actually a giant middle finger to the [ __ ] tlj bombers it's like look why wings we have them they're useful yay even though moments later Palpatine turns the tide right back he throws kylo down a hole because I guess he was pissed that he was thrown down a hole I don't know from there he powers up his lightning and he unleashes the Titanic Gay upon the Galactic fleet Oh sidenote draining the life out of people apparently gives him red clothing yeah I don't know anyway he basically kills everything like every ship for the good guys either explodes or gets turned off he somehow manages to avoid destroying his own fleet with this move I guess he's just super accurate because that's how lightning works the interesting part is that everybody we don't recognize gets exploded however people like zouri Lando and Poe just sort of fall over but they never crash or anything it is like the most literal representation of suspending someone in animation because they don't want them to win or lose in this moment but yeah I suppose it bears mentioning that I was kind of surprised that you can get Sith powers to the point of electrocuting and destroying thousands of ships like I remember reading about this as a leak and I just didn't believe it but [ __ ] it that's a thing now so ray gets upset when seeing all of this and decides to call out to all past Jedi since she's the last one and we know they're all dead among the voices is ahsoka tano so yeah congratulations on pissing off yet another faction of fans that exist in your audience Disney I guess she's dead now so obi-wan qui-gon Yoda Leia Luke mace Windu Anakin and several others all encourage her to [ __ ] up Palpatine because hey that's where this whole saga was leading right all of those stories were designed to bring a hero to the forefront to destroy the villain and that hero's name is Rey Palpatine creamy sheave tries to hit her with lightning but she blocks it with a lightsaber she blocks galactic fleet destroying lightning with her lightsaber okay mister palps then delivers what I can only describe as cognitive diarrhea like a literal loose watery stool of the mind he says who boy I am all the syph written and directed by an adult and what does Rey say in response wow you straight-up ripped off Marvel there [ __ ] hell so she deflects the Lightning back at him and instead of it giving him a ball bag for a face it disintegrates him I guess mace windu should he use two lightsabers that way he might have one with a single he sucked it out of her but she has a lightsaber overloaded and exploited the instant that lightning hit for help to death I goes no there is no K but what about two lightsabers palpite ISM slowly melts to the point of my wondering what the [ __ ] he was doing still firing lightning at Rey when half of his face is a [ __ ] skeleton but he dies anyway Rey killed Emperor Palpatine not Anakin Rey the rest of the ships in the final order explode and all of our heroes escape ex ago isn't that just the satisfying ending to the Skywalker saga we always wanted I didn't [ __ ] think so anyway Rey dies from that for reasons even finn feels it in the force which means Palpatine can just inhabit her body now right I thought his whole thing was inhabiting bodies in general and once he's killed he can just move to another one like she did exactly what he wanted it to do so I guess he wins well either way kylo manages to climb up the hole and heal Rey back to life they they kiss [ __ ] why [Music] look as if reloj fans were the ones you needed to please also he dies after that he just disappears he's dead apparently this is a situation where they couldn't have both of them live like they couldn't share half the gay each it had to be a full gay for one of them but even if that's the case I'm not sure why Ray didn't disappear when she died in fact I have no idea how any of this works healing has massive implications okay they not only screw up how its employed that you know what what cost is there to heal because it doesn't cost ray anything she healed and she's perfectly fine but when Kyla heals he kills himself so every single Star Destroyer simply falls out of the sky after having their respective guns destroyed I guess or they just destroyed normally hell we even see one of them getting destroyed by a one in a million holder maneuver we see them fall over Endor bespin and other planets in general which makes no sense at all because if they're in range to be attacked by the locals then surely they were in range to have destroyed a planet or at least wage a war like we know for a fact that one of the planet destroying star destroyers is still out there what the hell happened to it the first order is defeated easily because obviously they never stood a [ __ ] chance the rebellion then celebrate their hard-won victory and we can be rest assured that puppy is dead he's definitely dead this time a real victory not that fake [ __ ] from episode six this is the real stuff folks we even get a random lesbian kiss from two characters I don't recognize oh and it's been cut from other versions of the film to avoid controversy maybe one day Disney will even have a main character that's gay those soulless deceitful [ __ ] corrupted monkey [ __ ] Oh Chewie gets given Leia's medal by the way remember how he like didn't get his medal in Episode four and how there's a [ __ ] ton of memes about that this film made sure that if they'd nail any scene it would be the one that gets Chewie his [ __ ] medal [ __ ] off to close out the film we see ray Barry the Skywalker lightsabers in luke's old home I can't imagine Anakin was very happy about his lightsaber being permanently entombed by several feet of sand though more importantly I think we can all agree that Luke's home should be in a [ __ ] museum at this point a Galactic celebratory shrine of heroism and it would likely have tourism an introspection about how this farm boy managed to topple an empire but [ __ ] it JJ never gave a [ __ ] about will building so why start now also it's pretty interesting that Ray's straight up buries the Skywalker light sabers it's arguably pretty symbolic she casts Luke Anakin and Leia's legacies into the dirt while going on to live as though she is the hero of this galaxy I'm sure I'm just reading into it it's not like she took their name either way ray checks out her new lightsaber a custom one that she made okay why weren't you using that one instead of Anakin's what I and you gave the eye what Luke made his own lightsaber because he lost the other one as she finished her training now [ __ ] off a stranger comes by asking for Ray's full name and she sees Leia and Jake off in the distance leaving her to take the name Rey Skywalker you can't just take their name you petulant celery stick [ __ ] you standing at the duel sons [ __ ] Jew duck [ __ ] what this isn't your name to take you piece of [ __ ] how is bb-8 hanging out with you bb-8 is Poe's [ __ ] droid give it back you greedy cow okay that's credits that's credits we did it we made it let's let's calm down us chill out and have a chat shall we what a biblical [ __ ] what a perfect way to drive the corpse of this franchise into the [ __ ] pits of Tartarus what a way to signal to the audience that you really really hate this IP where do I begin the wheel building has once again been sidelined or ignored for the sake of spectacle and throwaway lines we know nothing of the situation with the first order and their control an apparent year has passed since the destruction of the Republic and the planets throughout the galaxy have simply been ignored what do people think about the first order outside of the fact that they just turn up at the end are they even in control of anything what about the so-called free planets how exactly are they even free didn't best bin fall to a single seed from a star destroyer why did they even resist why would any planet even resist something as powerful as the first order how would they even resist what is happening in this world how did Lando know that there were only two McMuffins I like how there's this mystical super secret sith base planet that's hidden by storms waves and space cancer yet almost everybody in the galaxy turns up there by the end of the film thanks to a McMuffin getting copied and pasted to everyone how did general pride make it through the space cancer with his Star Destroyer how does anyone make it through with static coordinates when the space cancer is constantly shifting how did he even do it in general he didn't have a McMuffin and kylo had switched teams by the time he needed it that makes no [ __ ] sense did he just send general pride a McMuffin over the Wi-Fi at which point making everything to do with the McMuffins really stupid it's like they put so much effort into explaining how it's never been known previously and it's so difficult to reach but then it's as common as the [ __ ] gas station by the end of the movie I kind of want to talk about how dar [ __ ] Uzi has a key to the home address on his knife for [ __ ] sake why would Palpatine not keep the McMuffins at EXA goal why would he even have McMuffins why would he want people to potentially stumble upon his planet couldn't he just send people to go and fetch the people he wants at X ago at better yet he should send people out to get the McMuffins and keep the Mexico so that he can decide who gets there and who doesn't there's no [ __ ] need for all of this contrived [ __ ] why would he let the assassin that he sends to people of interest kill with a knife that has directions leading to his planet for [ __ ] sake why would the assassin want that if Palpatine's a clone then why is he essentially a corpse if he's got his own new body then wouldn't it have full function but then if it's not a clone how the [ __ ] did he survive the explosion twice if Palpatine didn't die from what happened to him in Return of the Jedi then why are we supposed to believe he's really dead this time how is it that Palpatine is accepted and known to all of these people yet not one year ago Luke Skywalker was a [ __ ] myth everybody just accepts that he's back as well there's no questions because we have no [ __ ] time do they not find it concerning that the information they are collecting from the spy was pretty much useless since it only said there's a fleet there's a planet and you're going to lose if it were me and we got that information and the first order just happened to find us moments later than I don't know I'd think it was a trap remember when Rey's lightning destroyed the transport ship and then supercharge Palpatine's lightning managed to turn some of them off and mess with their controls that's cool if they managed to miniaturize the Death Star tech so it can be used by ships then why didn't they just divert all resources into making those instead of building both the Death Star's and the star killer base why didn't Palpatine just continue to use the big gay to push the Star Destroyers even further up if they can't figure out up for themselves also because of the whole no shields thing and how if you shoot the open cannon of the ship [ __ ] random a wings can instantly destroy a Death Star Destroyer who [ __ ] designed these things the stakes have been raised only to be slapped right back down which is hilarious considering the retcon of holders maneuver in order to create stakes again only to destroy them yet again himself oh ok if ghosts can grab lightsabers and lift X wings and shoot lightning then why the [ __ ] aren't they helping people they care about I suppose that'll be a never ending question wait hang on like Luke seriously you only told Lando about this why was Luke okay with burning down the sacred act in the temple if they had the only clues to the McMuffins that are the only chance to getting to EXA goal and stopping Palpatine [ __ ] he wrote the one of mrs. [ __ ] diary why are you so terrible seriously can you just leave Luke Skywalker alone you [ __ ] ruined him I came to this island to die let's talk about the plot if you can call this a plot I would call it a JJ Abrams wet dream the man cannot function without mysteries action every five minutes a bazillion vistas the ticking clock and of course steaming hot McMuffins when writing this script one of the biggest concerns was that I wouldn't be able to explain the plot in a way that made sense the film loses its mind at several points it takes the meme of having a secret will that's found by a McMuffin that's found by a different McMuffin that's found by a coordinate that's found by an informant that's informed by a spy that has no previous existence as a spy and they turned it into a [ __ ] script how do you do this and take yourself seriously how did kylo know where to find the first McMuffin when it was hard as [ __ ] to find the second one why would creamy sheave tell the galaxy about his re-emergence when he's not even ready to destroy them all and he hasn't got a full functioning body yet why did he commit to his galaxy domineering plot at the same time he wanted to commit to his body swap plot the first order were already taking over the universe and in terms of just nonsense why the hell didn't he stop using his lightning when it was killing him he would stop doing the lightning when it started disintegrating him stop pissing like midstream if Palpatine made Snoke and had him ruling over the world with the first order then why didn't he send the other ships why wasn't he ruling instead why bother with all the snoke's [ __ ] he was you in everything but name what's the [ __ ] point it's almost like it's a giant retcon and the fact that Snoke almost had Rey killed would have [ __ ] up Hal peas plans for the whole movie lucky everything turned out the way it did huh how didn't Luke and Lando have yuichi ships stripped apart for any clues because if they did they would have found do the droid with a [ __ ] technical readout of XE Gul I wonder how significantly that would have changed the events of this saga do you remember when they said there was no time to go back to base from personís oc3 bo said he'll have to make his sacrifice well they were still going to head to coogee me and then to the end or system and then back to base and then still over 2x ago couldn't they've just gone to their base copied c-3po is memory with r2d2 and then do the memory reset they could still then go to the end or system actually why the [ __ ] wasn't r2d2 on this mission with them what was he doing back at base just chilling out he was in the opening mission but he's not on the mission that'll win the [ __ ] war they take [ __ ] c-3po on the mission but not r2d2 I understand the value of an interpreter but [ __ ] me oh we haven't even talked about the insane luck both good and bad characters just running around this film like [ __ ] bowling balls bouncing off everything they come into contact with they just get pushed to their designated endings through luck I don't know that anyone makes an informed choice in this film it all just seems to be immediate like is that what they would do I don't know go Lady Luck is given a name in this film and that name is the gay characters with spontaneous knowledge characters with abilities or access that allow them to enter the next scene with no problem characters who live or die based on the fact that something random and unlikely takes place it's wonderful it's a big old [ __ ] roller coaster and it leads to the destruction of what remained of the OT speaking of which good by the force any chance of you being consistent as left out the [ __ ] window with Luke Han and Leia we got it bringing people back from the dead in more ways than one we got Skype calls teleporting [ __ ] we are now capable of normal chats at will no hologram calls required we got the absorption of all past Jedi to beat all past SIF how about healing SIF spirit ghost inhabiting bodies like they took no [ __ ] time to explain any of these things this is not something you can just throw around in the final chapter how does ray know how to do this how is it the kylo seeing her do it makes it so he knows how to do it you have to let us know how it works I don't even let's talk about characters shall we Ray is trying to discover what her lineage is so that she can discover something about herself again and as a result of that we don't have any time to learn anything about her again because her lineage is not actually important to her character which is what they said in the force awakens and that she can find people who become influential to her crafting her character instead of looking back and that's if I'm being very generous only that changed in tlj - it's not that it's not important it's that it's nobody that would matter which doesn't actually make sense in universe but it does make sense in a meta commentary sort of way because we all expected her to be a Kenobi a Skywalker or a Palpatine what the writers fail to grasp is that even if her mother's name was Jane Doe she would still be a character she would still have a history she wouldn't be nobody to Rey either way it still means it's ultimately not important and they wasted another movie of development time to say nothing which leads us here a story that tells us no it's not that it's nobody and it's not that it doesn't matter it's that it's somebody but it's somebody that doesn't define her somebody that doesn't matter the entire trilogy has spent so long telling us that Rey isn't defined by any other person that they forgot to define her and so right at the end they have her say that she's a Skywalker what does that even mean for her and it's interesting that you would choose to identify in the same family trees the guy who just [ __ ] kissed but alright and as a result of that ending this trilogy has now solidified itself as the surgical bastardization of Galactic Heroes that paved the way for this stinking Maya's existence in the first place every single solo and Skywalker of [ __ ] dead a Palpatine is left to move on in this galaxy while using the hero's name what a [ __ ] win for the Emperor but don't forget just because Disney killed him doesn't mean he's gone because no one's ever really gone am i right you [ __ ] and you know what else this is supposed to be Mustafa this McMuffin is supposed to belong to Darth Vader why the [ __ ] didn't Anakin help Luke when he was looking for Darth Ichi why didn't he tell Luke about his own [ __ ] McMuffin why didn't he tell people that Palpa [ __ ] was still alive what the [ __ ] did you do to Anakin Skywalker's [ __ ] legacy you abysmal [ __ ] mole kylo commits to being a good guy this time no idea why just [ __ ] it he hadn't tried it in a while I guess it was Han Solo that truly pushed him over the edge generated from kylos memory even though he was recently told that Palpatine has been faking every voice in his head so he just looks even [ __ ] stupid or now but what else have we got going for the bad guys Snoke was an incredibly powerful force user that Palpatine could [ __ ] out of a Sith making machine for [ __ ] sake Hux is a plot device he's barely in the film and of what screen time he actually had he's humiliated and murdered but not before setting up the plot for our heroes and sparing them from it when they're about to be executed general Hux being the defecting officer of the modern empire is used as a quick excuse for our heroes to make it out when that could have been a story on its own he could have been treated with some respect and made for quite the turn of a character but nope like if Huck's his goal was to simply kill kylo then why was he feeding information on how to defeat the entire first order like he literally tells people how and when the first order will attack and what EXA goal is what the [ __ ] does that have to do with killing kylo Ren like you would have better luck with hiring a bounty hunter for [ __ ] sake I want to bring up the fact that like loads of ghosts that could have turned up just don't through so many events in this movie none of them care beyond getting sucked into Rey as she kills pal P which is kind of weird isn't it the Jedi just had to awkwardly stare at Rey and kylo as they were getting drained and they thought to themselves [ __ ] it we got to do this ourselves lads hop in not to mention qui-gon jinn was supposed to be the first to discover the means to become a ghost right then how do we here Mace Windu's voice like didn't he die before any of that could have happened I how the [ __ ] was he a ghost and if it's just all of them then how the [ __ ] wasn't there a [ __ ] sleek cavalcade of voices Luke's straight up pushes ray to go and kill Palpatine which actually led to all creamy being able to rejuvenate himself completely and you know with her being near death if Palpatine just chose to finish here I'll push it down the same hole that kylo is in the saga would have been [ __ ] over that would have been super awkward for Luke but you know [ __ ] it Palpatine says that if he's killed by Rey that he can transfer to Rey and then he just doesn't when those events actually take place I know I brought that up before but I just can't get over it it's just insane I guess I should bring up that finn has a setup for loving Rey like he has a moment where he tries to say it and it's dropped and nothing comes of it like why have that and do nothing with it what a way to waste the other protagonists in this series Leia gets her emotional death scene when they could have began the film with a tasteful funeral or had her survived the film instead they essentially weep for her and then kick on with your normal Star Wars experience Poe may as well have not been in the film Chewie Maz snap marry the rest of these chuckle [ __ ] they don't really do much of anything in terms of character there's nothing here the Knights of Ren are laughable it's like JJ put them there just to spite Ryan for not including them but all they do is fail to complete their goals there are about zero scenes for people to actually learn and grow or change in any significant way it's so busy explaining how the plot is going to work that there's just no time characters make snap decisions there's no introspection there's no discussion and they introduce a whole bunch of new people for no [ __ ] reason Zhora bliss this girl Babu Frick not to mention Darth [ __ ] do Chi Poe is apparently a person who did spice running at one point okay we had a scene to set that up that made no sense and then we had it paid off and nothing but providing some context on how he's friends with this person and that's about it not even shrek got development speaking of which holy [ __ ] the retconning I knew to expect some but this was wild Anakin's lightsaber fixed Kyla's mask repaired general Hux [ __ ] punted and replaced with his old self shrek heated out of this script in a heartbeat Luke being a coward admitted mistake Luke throwing his lightsaber admittedly disrespectful Finn sacrificing himself without a person to stop him and being successful sorted Rey's lineage well she's not no one anymore is she she's a creamy sheev Palpatine is JJ aware of how many [ __ ] video essays he just made obsolete thousands of videos celebrating Ryan's masterpiece are now inaccurate to say the least not that they weren't before and [ __ ] me whether or not it contradicted Ryan's abortion I cannot help but cackle as this fiery coffin of a trilogy plummets further into the sludgy annals of schizophrenic script hell that should have been made illegal well before release though I suppose it should be said that JJ tried he tried to give our main cast an adventure together he tried to give Rey the training everybody wanted to see he tried to show her fail he even killed her despite it being temporary because hey the plot isn't gonna let a MarySue die now is it well there's a bunch of concessions there JJ a couple of Ryan retcons and a couple of things to make up for what lacked in this trilogy it's a selection of things I'm sure you figured people would have wanted well too little too late you Hobgoblin [ __ ] when you try to pander to literally everyone except here J fans you end up pandering to no one door movie Robert for some reason like it's clear from the whole resurrecting thing that they do throughout this that JJ wanted everything he wanted everyone to survive but to also have a bunch of dramatic death scenes he wanted 1,000 times the scale for the bad guys and the good guys because he watched it an Avengers end game and that's how you end a big story he wanted a plot that took us galaxies trotting meeting all kinds of colorful characters and why did that happen because they needed to fetch a thing that we've never heard of or seen before packed with throwaway lines to attempt to excuse this defiled wretch of a story I think the saddest moment for me was watching Chewbacca be told that not only are Han and Luke dead but as of returning to base Leia is dead too all of them are dead all of it is [ __ ] dead thank goodness reh Palpatine made it though while walking into that duel [ __ ] sunset I guess if I was being kind I would mention that I actually thought c-3po killed it in this movie I smoked at a couple of his lines and I actually cared about the idea of him being placed in a situation where he agrees to sacrifice himself to save his friends based on the odds of survival despite being a more cowardly character but the mechanics of how that came to be made no sense at all they didn't earn it and the fact that our 2d2 have been backing up his memory kind of implies that his wife during Revenge of the Sith is now a bit of a shaky point as well I like Babu Frick that little [ __ ] the soundtrack was neat if not essentially throwing everything in the saga together I liked watching Lando and Chewie meet up and hug that was nice the visuals were pretty stunning as expected though the editing and the pacing what shoppi is [ __ ] and they nearly killed me the actors did a fine job with what they were given and I had quite a few laughs intended or not you know what yeah this was a masterpiece and any of those haters those man babies out there who are hating on the film because they are purely hateful sexist all because the story subverted their hateful expectations all because they missed the deeper themes because of their hatred but missed no opportunity to suck their own dick oh those awful people who incite harassment based on innocent cast and crew members [ __ ] those man children specifically the force awakens attempted to retcon the original trilogy the last Jedi attempted to retcon the force awakens and the original trilogy the rise of Skywalker attempts to retcon just about everything Lucasfilm has no [ __ ] clue what they're doing no one there respects the IP or the process of writing in these films and as a result we have a worthless trilogy that can honestly be watched without the last Jedi now like if you pretend that Snoke and Luke had heart attacks from TFA everything plays out except of course for all the damage that's been dealt to those wonderful movies set in a galaxy far far away as if it wasn't enough to assassinate Han as if it wasn't enough to a sassanid Luke you had to rip the victory of Anakin Skywalker right out of his hands that fool didn't kill the Emperor Anakin didn't bring balance to the force because Palpatine never died Anakin didn't save the galaxy because the first order rose not long after Palpatine survived Anakin didn't end the war and save those heroes of this will because they all ended up humiliated and/or dead they didn't win at the end of that movie if anything you could skip the OT because it's mostly inconsequential to the greater saga of Ray vs Palpatine and none of these [ __ ] characters behave like themselves anyway that is the legacy of Disney Star Wars the [ __ ] Undertaker's of a cinematic wonder the copycats who came in late to pick at the leftovers of something great without ever understanding how it got there get [ __ ] you hollow money-grubbing [ __ ] thanks for watching folks I guess I'll see you next time [Laughter] [Music] you I'm Peter by the way rice toluca made-up names um I'm spider-man then "

people where he can and wants to achieve to have his parents feel a sense of pride as time goes on his father is less and less available he even misses his son's greatest sporting achievements and this in part connects to an accident that takes cyborg's mother's life and leaves him mortally wounded his father uses a magic box to give his son his body back but his son hates him for it alongside the accident having created resentment he thinks himself a monster without a family a broken man looking for a reason to live he begins to realize his power can be used to help the entire world the possibilities are almost overwhelming the first step is deciding to give a woman some extra money as she is a verifiable good person and she's down on her luck on his path to reconnecting with his father he has led to the justice league and when trying to rescue him an understanding is achieved only his endeavor with the justice league and the mother boxes leads to his father's death a noble one perishing for a good cause moving forward it would be unacceptable not to do as much as he can and even the idea of being consumed by the unity when trying to prevent it doesn't stop his resolve he doesn't waver and in the climax of the film he discovers that his past life his body and his family are gone but that doesn't mean he's alone or broken and so with some help from the team he defeats the incoming enemy force and finds a new lease on life inspiring silas his father is quite the character as well a man of science quite smart and loving in his own way his work took precedent in much of his life but when the choices came when the difficulties arose he was willing to give up his life in an instant for the betterment of the world and man he is quite the actor i won't let you die the film boasts a star-studded cast it has some great sound design and tracks throughout of a fascinating variety the color grading cinematography and lighting are all cohesive for a particular vision the aspect ratio respects the original filming preferences and the special effects are fantastic sometimes now that i've covered all that let's talk about the other three hours and 50 minutes superman is dead and this means the mother boxes are waking from having heard his scream but what are the mother boxes well they are living machines you see machines of change they were created to come together as a three and terraform the planet according to the enemy's home world why not have them pre-built as a single thing to do the thing i i don't know also kind of weird how would it know like the concept of a friendly or an enemy or an owner of a planet i guess does it copy the current state of the home world what if you have no home world um anyway once upon a time way back in the day it would seem that a big alien set foot on earth in hopes of terraforming it with his sorcerer people this didn't work because this was earth and earth had aries zeus artemis a green lantern the amazonians the atlanteans and the race of men coming together to defend it big alien also known as darkseid gets whomped in the neck his ships destroyed his armies defeated his boxes stolen and his anti-life equation abandoned because he couldn't hack it in this battle the anti-life equation is carved into the surface of this very world are you certain i have looked with my own eyes interestingly however this was the only loss for darkseid in millennia across the multiverse the only world dark side had ever lost the only time he was beaten the only time someone made him bleed the only place that ever stole his mother boxes from him and the only place in existence with the anti-life equation we have this confirmed to us by steppenwolf finding it on this planet in a vision provided by the motherbox the very same thing the dark side found when he was first here he found it hidden on a primitive planet the world that fought back it is earth after disrobing he tells senpai darkseid all about this and darkseid is very excited talking about how taking that planet is essentially his main whole deal it will give him control over the entire multiverse he wants his stuff back and he wants them to submit excellent we have our world building and all of existence shall be mine the lost world is earth i have turned 100 000 worlds to dust looking for those who robbed me of my glory why would none of them be aware that this is the same planet thus leading them to it prior to now fading from the view of the enemy anonymous among a trillion worlds darkseid kind is well known i have found the primitive planet he in his vast space-faring multiverse traveling high-tech army forgot which planet had all of these incredibly important aspects of his life take place nobody thought to write this down the coordinates the name the system nothing he almost died when he returned to apocalypse he was in a fight for power and much time passed before he was in a position of power again and by then all who'd been with him had been slayed so with the additional director's input we can confirm darkseid and every system of recording at his disposal kinda forgot about earth also all of the people present for this are dead and also everyone knows the story okay you forgot to pop this in your story there zack not that it makes a difference you probably didn't have the time if you did you could have had zeus create some kind of invisibility field for the entire planet one that he similarly created for themyscira maybe it weakened him allowing aerys to take his shot something that even affects the systems that attempt to lock onto earth's coordinates jumbling the information it helps explain it to some degree while bolstering wonder woman 84 because that film needs it while showing you actually care about other people's movies in this franchise i wonder if there's proof of the opposite you know darkseid's further when talking about this planet actually has me wondering andy life is found assad and we will stop at nothing to possess it why doesn't he teleport in there with his army steppenwolf can use it all the time whenever he wants surely darkseid can too and he wants this place more than anything they are literal seconds from completing their plan right here and he can walk right in there with his parademon army with his omega beams with desaad with um and [ __ ] up the entire place you'd think he'd invade the moment he found out when this world is scorched i will come for my great prize and all of existence shall be mine hmm okay the thing that lets you control all life and you're not going to try and grab it seems a little out of character for the sake of the plot line but what do i know what's a bit weirder is that if the boxes brought these lads in then why did they wait so long the opening goofy ass visual tells us that superman's screams make the motherboxes call to steppenwolf because superman is dead they seem to have a desire of their own to announce that earth is ready for the taking when clark is dead so why not make that announcement before he was even born before he even got to earth he arrived like 35 years ago you boxed things had a huge stretch of millennia to simply call in reinforcements not to mention that clark screamed a plenty in his movies is there a different tone for a death scream what if he died by decapitation no death scream and thus no waking up what if his scream didn't travel the distance he was kryptonite adjacent after all his power isn't at its highest and why doesn't someone like zod yelling not have a similar effect are the boxers really only going to wake up when they hear what they understand to be earth's mightiest hero screaming as he dies which by the way if his scream is travelling these distances then the amount of power it has at the origin point would create a [ __ ] sound nuke and that's a conservative estimate they didn't wake up when he got temporarily deaded in space so why are they waking up when he's temporarily deaded now do they care if he goes off-world do they know what the [ __ ] are these things joss whedon made it so that they woke up to the feeling of fear engulfing the people of earth that fixes like a lot of this that humanity would be more afraid now with their alien protector dead after having killed doomsday and you know there's a worry that more might come justice league is absolutely the inferior film by the way don't worry about that just an interesting comparison why is it that only one of them wakes up fully and the other two sits still despite all three waking upon the death of superman is all of this for the convenience of the plot imagine if silas's box was the first to wake up steppenwolf takes it with ease and the other two well they weren't exactly difficult to get it's essentially said that the mother boxes are technology made by darkseid's team so why not bring three new ones for this task unless of course they are limited in which case how could you possibly have forgotten this planet it would seem that according to diana everyone is aware during the war that if these three boxes unify then the world is burned and everyone is turned into parademons that sucks but hey they fought back and won only the amazonians put the box in a big stone temple thing with guards who apparently sit there every day waiting for it to wake up seems unlikely but you know what kind of reasonable considering its immense destructive power the atlanteans put the box on a pedestal with about five guys around it um less impressive but there we are then there's man he stuck it in a hole a shallow [ __ ] are you [ __ ] kidding me these things if collected caused the end of the world all three of you [ __ ] [ __ ] civilizations need to have the maximum coverage and guard on these things they should be in the heart of your cities they have the power to destroy everything if the enemy has to destroy your city to get it that's gonna make no broader difference but i guess a whole is good enough the bloody nazis found that one for [ __ ] sake not long after this was decided the amazonians had a war with the atlanteans with man enslaving the amazonians as well so all three civilizations stopped talking to each other which is somewhat understandable but then the amazonian one is stolen and it's like ah they're probably gonna you know send a scouting party to inform diana and the world of men or send a raven or a [ __ ] message in a bottle has more chance of working than this does i honestly didn't expect them to have a drawn out ceremony where they somehow managed to fire a flaming arrow across the ocean that sets a stone building on fire that's picked up by a new station that's spotted by diana who flies out there to inspect and manages to take the arrow before evidence did with no police barrier or prevention only to then jump down to some catacombs in the area [ __ ] heels of steel by the way to then open a mystical stone door by placing a magical arrow on the wall and then she can view the wonderful artwork that might give her a vague impression of what the [ __ ] is happening and what she should do have you heard of [ __ ] email get a hot spot you backward-ass [ __ ] troglodytes i expect the planet being on the verge of destruction should give you more motivation to save it than firing an arrow [ __ ] you man has nukes now they might just be able to help it takes about a half [ __ ] hour to get through these scenes and they only accomplish the same degree of storytelling as a single conversation diana could have had with her mother remember she can [ __ ] fly out there it would have been a strong opportunity for exposition and characterization for wonder woman beyond pining for chris not to mention spouting platitudes in each scene can i be like you someday you can be anything you want to be yeah okay let's talk about this scene diana was shown to avoid killing people in both of her solo movies as much as this idea is not fully realized the sentiment is there it's patty's design in the opening of this film she is seen delivering such lethal blows that blood splatters are delivered to the surrounding walls she annihilates people to the point of blasting through doorways unconcerned for those on the other side like what if there was some children tied up right there then she keeps making terrible decisions like blocking every round in the rifle by skirting across the ground rather than moving toward the man firing she moves faster than sound what the [ __ ] is this decision did you just want to look cool because it wasn't cool then there's her lack of movement while he fully reloads his gun she could have taken it and punched him she could have used that lasso she constantly forgets she has she could have put him to the ground instead she gives him the god-killing super move what the [ __ ] she [ __ ] vaporized him she destroyed a huge portion of this building she endangered the lives of every child there she's lost her [ __ ] mind after witnessing this maniac cause a significant disaster possibly killing several people outside with the debris [ __ ] people up too on top of painting the room with the blood of her enemies all motivated by a sense of vengeance alone a little girl asks if she can be anything she wants and wonder woman confirms awkward considering she's a demigod with the power to nuke buildings by slamming her braces together because she was born of a special species but more importantly this scene hits in no other way than [ __ ] farcical let's not forget what happened to the last person who wanted to be like you diana even now patronizing me but i hear you ask how does one fix this if they were giving it an edit well maybe remove the blood and cut the scene as she does her blast maybe you allow the audience to assume that her blast was just a small one and it only hit this guy over instead of confirming that she chopped a chunk out of a building while turning this man to ash i suppose that's the best way to mitigate the sheer character assassination on screen if only someone could try something like that in an alternate cut oh these children need to see a doctor by the way back to the dark ages four city blocks oh my goodness we're gonna be blowing up enough of london to return the modern world to the dark ages four blocks that's pretty big for doing that okay fire is not a tiger and that is not for city blocks in a few minutes four city blocks the counter begins at one minute you mong also you're not even capable of lying what the [ __ ] is this line also she returns right as he shoots the gun was she waiting to look awesome if she saves people or did she really only turn up one second earlier than needed in which case lucky as [ __ ] this guy ran out of bullets and took exactly as long as he did to reload or things might have gone a little different i mean what the [ __ ] took you so long she moves at the speed of sound and tanks headbutts from [ __ ] superman a wonder woman is no longer just a rapist she's a psychopath congratulations her characterization in this movie is [ __ ] embarrassing when looking strictly at her actions she's joined the ranks of some of the most reckless heroes heroes that are in the job for the appreciation but scenes that are specific for telling us who she is are essentially non-existent i lost someone i loved once no you lost him twice i shut myself off from from everyone no you continued saving people for years and you rescued the planet from destruction thanks to wishes going awry my goodness thanks for respecting continuity there zack lil patty you guys can figure that out i've killed things from other worlds before no you haven't okay as an alternative how about she has a scene where she explains her shame in failing to step up as a leader because she believes that steve's death is just one example of the many to come when she begins to tell people to put their lives on the line for a cause this is the job it's my job and i haven't been doing it i've been reacting not leaving to step into the light and to say to people this is worth your life they're all steve trevor but she knows she has to step up because her team member is mortal and he can't lead forever you could have this scene double up as her having concern for a team member's health health that shows his position in the battle prompting her to express through action and dialogue that she cares for the team on a personal level life on a macro level and balancing the responsibility of taking care of this world instead of reminiscing on that chris [ __ ] this conversation could get started because she notices bruce isn't fully recovered from the battle again reinforcing that she keeps an eye on this sort of stuff maybe if we could drop a scene like that into the movie we could improve it somewhat speaking of batman his lack of superpowers puts him in a far more vulnerable state wonder woman could even correct his shoulder while talking to him about having brought in lois lane three things at once he and wonder woman have a stronger friendship developing we make it through tonight we can stay in the shadows forever dress up like a bat or even sue if we get through the night he unlike the others can't tank significant hits humanizing him and reminding the audience of the sacrifice he makes and finally that lois lane was brought in by bruce we're going to come back to that you know a scene like that seems like a straight-up benefit to me be a shame if someone cut it out be a shame if batman was never acknowledged as the one taking the most risk being the most human be a real shame if batman worked really hard to rescue his friends in battle covering diana only to have this demon god jump onto his bat crab and try again and again to punch him to death it would be an additional shame if wonder woman chose to ignore this opting instead to jump off the platform away from him to collect her sword something she doesn't need to save her teammate from certain death it's not like this is made worse when the flash arrives sees a demigod trying to grab a sword versus the man trying to survive a hammering from edginess personified and chooses to push her sword into her hand instead of giving a quick and simple push to steppenwolf saving batman's life but this is in character you see the flash has a crush on wonder woman and he even has a moment where he listens to the commands bruce is giving and watches him get attacked [ __ ] over if you will but opts to ignore him i'll make sure these things follow me instead he gives a [ __ ] morale boost to people walking upstairs despite having the power to clear out the entire building's worth of creatures in five seconds or less you good i've got this keep moving [ __ ] worthless idiot can you help the one person on your team who is actually at risk of dying i mean it's not like batman does everything for this [ __ ] team without a modicum of respect i mean it's not like he's the one collecting and assembling the team taking care of logistics using his arsenal to save them and blow open the enemy base assaulting all of the enemies and essentially fighting a one-man war for five minutes straight while his superhumans waddle in the background thank goodness wonder woman collected her sword so that she didn't have to pick it back up when she landed regardless i hope bruce is still alive and i suppose the saddest thing is that bruce is characterized throughout the entire movie as i want to make a team for clark being heroes is good and at the end he's like woohoo i did it i made the team excellent job riveting in joss's version many reshoots concerned batman himself not just action scenes but moments to tell us what he had come to believe between the two films and what is driving him his strength doesn't matter how strong you are more human than i am after everything he went through to stop clark he's learned enough about him that he sees a man with stronger values than his own alongside a man who has lived a more thorough human experience than himself he lived in this world fell in love got a job despite all that power we know from his conversation with wonder woman later that he wants people to be inspired by heroes superman was a beacon to the world why aren't you which is on theme in joss's version with fear consuming the world yet bruce resigns himself to the shadows because he doesn't believe himself to fit that bill he feels he lacks that fundamentally important element to being a hero in this world and he's not even sure bruce wayne the man he essentially wears as a mask has anything close to it compared to clark kent he believes it should be clark that is the face of the justice league world needs superman and the team needs clark i think it becomes clear in the subtext that bruce wayne needs clark kent to maintain a personal hope as giving into fear of what may come to pass has led him down an uncomfortable and cruel road that's a hell of a lot more for his character than snyder ever did and it's building on stories that snyder [ __ ] started i've always thought of joss's cut to be an absolute garbage fire but when comparing it to an actual garbage fire i'm having different thoughts perhaps i treated you too harshly at least he actually has something compared to wonder woman's nothing at all which should push us to some level of plot discussion don't you think what the [ __ ] happened in this film steppenwolf is summoned to the first box and the amazonian queen devises a plan to drop the entire structure into the water by breaking the wooden pillars no idea how that works or why she spends so long discussing it when the entire world is at stake or why she takes so long to run up a wall only to come back down to strike one enemy all of that's pretty funny sure but the important question here is why the [ __ ] would you think that dropping this into the water would do anything when king goober over here literally teleported in his minions can fly [Music] oh boy you couldn't have guessed it what proceeds is a spectacular fight where questions raise faster than the arrows fly man you may as well have repurposed those guns you got from the germans to be more useful than a [ __ ] bow and arrow at this point then again aren't the arrowheads simply inside you now maybe the armor isn't that effective at all but it was so cool there's this moment where an amazon simply refuses to pick up the cube with her arm and the incredible amazonian agility we all know they have to instead throw her own bow at the ground rather than keeping it on her to use in a moment to then die in order to send the cube attached fire arrow to her queen who rode away when it fell to the right of her in the first place guarded with your life the queen the one who drowned many of her people for this box doesn't give a [ __ ] when it's rolling right by her and doesn't look to defend her people as they die to get it back to her i guess she knew it would work out she just hopes this woman can loose the arrow split seconds before being bisected speaking of what took the amazonians so long to arrive look how close their city is when the portal is first seen they're alerted immediately eight minutes go by and they couldn't get to steppenwolf even when our guys have done at least half the journey they may have been able to put a stop to steppenwolf's plan he had some trouble when six of them ganged up on him imagine a whole army had they been here on time or had the box been in their [ __ ] city this is over and with steppenwolf's departure why don't the amazonian army further pursue him this box is your responsibility it leads to the destruction of your world wake the [ __ ] up you oh that whole ocean of arrows is tearing the [ __ ] out of your queen by the way fire has not burned for 5 000 years men won't know what it means then go tell them yourself you witless muppet this is about the end of the [ __ ] world so steppenwolf eventually makes it to atlantis and takes their cube because king orm is [ __ ] told the king the perimeter guards were taken he won't send reinforcements he says all the reserves are needed in the rebel regions he straight up doesn't care that the world destroying cube is going to be taken he will not provide reinforcements they want me to believe that king orm doesn't care about losing his kingdom to an outsider and all seven kingdoms will have to concede that i am the one true king okay anything to make the plot move along [Applause] come to think of it why isn't mira making use of her royal guard if her father is alive he would of course care about this and send reinforcements and if he's actually dead then she inherits the kingdom please plow the rest of your [ __ ] team in here you insufferable wanker also why aren't you using your powers to [ __ ] with steppenwolf more efficiently like she normally opens it up with ease all the time but for some reason she opens it up once and then closes it again and then fails to open it back up for so long that she gets strangled by steppenwolf why isn't she using it to help aquaman here wait she's straight up letting him get away he's [ __ ] musing on his triumph with the box in hand and she's just watching what the [ __ ] are you doing i thought you were good at causing pain well only one box left good thing cyborg has it and after deciding it can resurrect superman based on [ __ ] all they give it the old college try only during the scene they all forget that the mother box exists for about 10 minutes would be great if someone was to go grab it while everyone is fighting over superman wouldn't it like while they're battling maybe a bat person isn't there because he's busy getting it nope the box is taken by silas stone and then by steppenwolf because batman wasn't doing anything until much later when he helps the soldier up wow lucky lois turns up to calm superman down eh at this time of year at this time of day in this part of the city localized entirely within this field of view yes man if only there was a cut here that gives us a reason for batman to be missing and for lois to have been brought in by someone going to get her like killing two birds by flying them the [ __ ] into each other if only someone made that cut anyway back to the box why did he conclude it was the smart decision to tag the box so that it could be found by the heroes instead of giving it to the heroes what the [ __ ] are you doing he had no reason not to and steppenwolf could have been killed right there the movie might have ended had silas decided not to [ __ ] hit it with a laser that he apparently did to mark the box with super heat thus detectable with a scan for temperature anomalies what if it [ __ ] cools down silas it's a magic box for [ __ ] sake 3.5 million calvin what the [ __ ] do you think a reasonable high temperature is that would literally explode the air around it earth is a crisp the moment you described that was the case and [ __ ] me as if there isn't a unique signature for bruce to track already on these undestroyable energy change machines from the multiverse come the [ __ ] on come to think of it how did silas even create cyborg because the ship was alien and the box was kinda alien and a source of energy and that might just save him if you plug him into it the [ __ ] what is the thought process here how did silas get away with sticking his dying son to a wall while experimenting on him how does he even have access to the body look at it no way a hospital or a government would allow this level of inhumane testing how the [ __ ] does he even have the body and there's no way silas got approval to do this how the [ __ ] did he get away with taking the box or seemingly misplacing it why wouldn't these parademons having broken in and stolen several workers not have been a huge alert immediately how is the security so [ __ ] to allow all of these nonsense things to happen this is like the most valuable thing on the earth guys the dod aren't simply going to allow it to be misplaced it's a mystical relic from the [ __ ] nazis with immense power how could he possibly get it out of there and drop it into his closet all of these things going this way is the only way we get cyborg at all seems a little [ __ ] to me he even establishes that his son now simply has the power to launch nukes his teenage son who hates him thinks of himself as a monster and semi regularly talks about how [ __ ] the people of earth are despite clearly trying to help these people that's a little concerning my dude [ __ ] the world yeah we're gonna talk about the dialogue later the ethical questions relating to cyborg in terms of his power level and the decisions he has to make are incredible what a topic to raise and then not explore at all what a kind thing he did giving this woman one hundred thousand dollars from the bank when that will be spotted instantly by the irs and tracked only to discover that someone somewhere was stolen from and she will be lucky to avoid jail time for grand larceny and taking full advantage of the crime but hey she was happy and he smiled that's character what a childish view of the monetary system we're a part of it's indicative of the sheer potential lost especially considering this is the strongest part of the movie speaking of how awesome cyborg is we've lost the mother box because he forgot steppenwolf was right behind him if he was on point he could have used his power to erase buildings and blast steppenwolf away but mauler you protest he was concerned for his father's life he was distracted i mean he could have blown steppenwolf away as soon as he landed but he didn't he could have flown over to his father broken the glass and gotten him out of there but he didn't and how could he be concerned for his father's life when he doesn't know what this machine even is ah i'm sorry i forgot he knows because he has full access and control over all machinery all over the world correct so why the [ __ ] didn't he turn that machine off and save his father why not turn it back on to [ __ ] melt steppenwolf and save the world you [ __ ] this story is broken he is aware of the machine and should stop it and he should be preventing steppenwolf from getting any closer and why the [ __ ] is he the only one here where is the justice league do you guys remember these people if only one of them could move fast let's talk about where they were [ __ ] i forgot this happened we get the fight scene almost exclusively from cyborg's suit just [ __ ] up like the mother box might have been saved clark might have [ __ ] helped them stop steppenwolf right here but your stupid suit just happens to fire an auto defense shot at superman because what it senses danger good thing it never [ __ ] cyborg over in any other way throughout the whole movie despite being in range of steppenwolf and darkseid it's almost like this only happens here specifically for the plot in joss's version we have plenty of references to cyborg still figuring this [ __ ] out i got a language in my head that i don't speak every day i wake up different modified as well as having another example of auto defense one that doesn't whine rather than having complete control it's not great but it's better and it's not four hours regardless of that how come wonder woman didn't tank the shot with her shield why didn't flash push cyborg or the arm why didn't aquaman [ __ ] do anything why didn't cyborg profusely apologize right after [ __ ] you work harder shut the [ __ ] up cyborg can tank superman's [ __ ] laser batman can tank superman's [ __ ] laser for this long what the [ __ ] thank the gods your [ __ ] butler created this technology for you yesterday jesus christ arthur we need to restrain him yeah you do why the [ __ ] didn't you bring kryptonite it literally renders clark semi harmless you have a whole ass spear of this stuff you [ __ ] idiots you're telling me the moment flash tries to attack clark aquaman attacks from behind and they hit each other knocking them both out of the fight thus preventing them from helping batman [ __ ] hell and all of you stupid [ __ ] forgot the motherbox this whole time it's the only major concern you have when you decided to resurrect superman your contention was on whether the box would activate bringing steppenwolf and thus the end of the world how do you forget that [ __ ] why is amnesia a [ __ ] epidemic in this universe moving on the team have a plan to come up with use cyborg to interface with the unity and charge him up to break them away with the flash having built up this charge from running how do they know this is how it works and that this will work they just do how do they know they have the time they just do how are they in time to do this they just ah these boxes together are world destroyers i'll get inside you and find your weaknesses and your fears and use them to destroy you what the how the [ __ ] do you know that what is this [ __ ] of course it facilitates his big payoff at the end of the film and that's kind of the problem because what the absolute [ __ ] the mother boxes will try and defeat you with your fears if you plug into them as a mother box created cyborg person while also being charged up with a speed force powered fast person diana knows this how why the [ __ ] is this even the thing that happens [ __ ] hell remind me why can't we have cyborg launch a nuke at the site explosives ones ever in the boxes only strengthen their bond why don't we just destroy it they're an unknown form of matter and they love heat they absorb it hold it in their cores oh they feed on energy so we can't really use energy as a source to uh separate the boxes if you will you know like electricity plasma i don't know a lightning bolt but i thought that separated the unity you [ __ ] mongoloids and even if it doesn't stop the unity a set of missiles will wipe out steppenwolf and his stupid bug army it will leave the unity unguarded for you guys to stop it with ease groups pull back you're not gonna make it gee if only someone had the ability to fire an arsenal at will to save the world but that lot ain't the only way this falls apart for instance imagine the unity was instant imagine it took just five minutes imagine it took an hour would be pretty awkward wouldn't it lucky it only took exactly the right amount of time that our heroes would need to stop it even with the ability to rewind time which kind of also breaks the movie right we have the ability to rewind time with no consequence whatsoever there's no butterfly effect and he has immense control the world is rewound exactly as he needs it to be to have specific platforms that take him to victor not to mention connecting to victor at the latest moment possible that charging him would work he was either astronomically lucky or he has absolute control over every aspect of this ability well beyond what we understand about his abilities and what we thought would be possible especially when a more seasoned flash apparently has far less control i don't like to break this rule but when i approach the speed of light i look crazy things happen to time but if i do it i create massive electrical power why would they establish that this is a rule he cannot break only to have him break it twice and save the world why wouldn't he do this whenever anything cataclysmic takes place whenever someone dies whenever he [ __ ] misses the bus imagine the flash took one minute to clear the bugs imagine he charged up and pushed steppenwolf right the [ __ ] away allowing cyborg the time he needs then when he's told they are ready run back and charge up to nail everything they need to do to save the [ __ ] world why would you not have flash clear the area why have him [ __ ] off and charge up so early when he ends up spinning for the entire fight he could be saving people nope we can't have that we get this plan a plan that still gives the team the upper hand only to almost ruin that because batman forgot to nail this one guy on a turret spamming for presumably as long as the flash has been running had flash noticed the sheer bombardment from that one bug he could have hit him and carried on running but nope neither the flash nor batman do and this one guy managed to nail this shot and that happened because the flash wasn't doing a circular track out of range of the turrets when he can move at the speed of [ __ ] light so distance away from cyborg isn't really going to change much at all and that's on top of cyborg deciding to plug into the unity before dealing with steppenwolf what the [ __ ] are you doing you have access to building destroying lasers stop steppenwolf to then prevent him from killing you and your teammates to then approach the [ __ ] unity you [ __ ] can you guys [ __ ] imagine if superman was one second too late and the axe splits cyborg's head open then again i guess that's not much of a worry when steppenwolf was absolutely not even close to hitting cyborg the [ __ ] aims like a sack of piss though it's a fun surprise right seeing all soups show up right when he's needed to the surprise of the team [Music] his name is clark you plank though it was good of alfred to guide superman here while simultaneously not telling bruce about it you'd think he'd let the idiots know that [ __ ] superman is on the way to save their lives but i guess he wanted it to be a nice surprise [ __ ] based alfred hoping the team was dead because they're so cringe but yeah hopping back imagine steppenwolf simply attacked instead of having himself a little walk around or imagine something even stupider like the flash ignoring cyborg when he tells him he's ready for the charge wait that doesn't happen does it i'm connected to the unity i need the charge to get inside you can move at the speed of light [ __ ] he told you he's ready [ __ ] go either this is a major hole or incredibly bad luck with shitty editing it's also [ __ ] because steppenwolf drops here with cyborg moving to the unity but we don't see him connect up for another 70 seconds what the [ __ ] is everyone doing in all of the moment-to-moment drama they just freeze if they aren't on screen this finale breaks apart almost as much as the rest of the plot only these flaws regard the destruction of earth you could call that significant but is it as significant as adding two hours only for the characters to be assassinated reduced confused or used as fan bait we've been over wonder woman and batman is basically hollow so how about the flash he is characterized by being awkward and lacking friends i need friends his father is falsely imprisoned he wants to get his father out and he's looking for a job he gets one by the end his foot's in the door that's my boy all of this is in the prior cut and it's not two hours [ __ ] longer in fact what gets added for flash is this scene this hilarious [ __ ] scene that people actually have the balls to praise a scene where a woman traveling at 20 miles per hour at most crashes into a car propelling it meters into the air flipping over and exploding in all of its 2003 cgi glory because zach is a child during this flash decides to focus not on all the drivers or pedestrians in the area that he could look out for or are affected instead he decides to stroke this woman's hair as she slowly plummets to her death he then pockets a hot dog and stares at her as he brings her to safety people are trying to justify this scene by saying it's his future love interest if anything that makes it more creepy imagine this scene was exactly the same but flash was played by movie bob it's also got such shitty editing that snyder wants us to think the flash got back in the room with the hot dog to convince the woman in the room that he wasn't out there though they show the store owner staring at the girl on the floor as the glass breaks the glass would break in real time after he pushed his finger through it and the car would have rolled in real time this exchange of looks happens in real time which means she saw him and your shitty editing can't change that also there are cameras on the topic of self-indulgent garbage zach why are you zooming into this man tickling the [ __ ] burger in slow motion zach why is there a [ __ ] sesame seed flinging into my screen i don't know that you could have made this driver stupider also what is this face you've been shot out of your car just after a [ __ ] crash you look bored and aroused you can be whatever you want to be you're brilliant man absolute best of the best your kid was one of them dad [Music] one of the best of the best this is the most substance the flash has in the movie and it's one line reflected back hardly what any reasonable person would call an arc or development just repeating a line he wants his father to be proud of him and so he did this i'm honestly surprised this didn't hit more people as an absolute flatline the flash's big payoff of being a great guy and doing a great thing was him deciding to use the powers that just got dropped on him randomly to save the world with no repercussion it's literally the flash sitting in a room with a button that says save the entire world and we're gushing over the fact that he pressed it do you honestly reserve immense levels of pride for someone who decides the world shouldn't end and makes that decision with absolutely zero cost to themselves only benefit i know we're supposed to hate joss right now and all of his works but you do understand that the reason this is meaningful right here is that tony's entire arc revolves around the perceived reality that he only cares about himself the only thing you really fight for is yourself you're not the guy to make the sacrifice play to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you i think i would just cut the wire he is regularly reminded of how much he wouldn't sacrifice while trying to make the world a better place at any expense that comes to him he guides the nuke to the mothership assuming it will kill him he is willing to die to save the earth because he believes it's the right thing to do that last call to pepper to say goodbye just missing her hits that little bit harder when realizing a three-movie arc leads to this payoff barry pressed a [ __ ] button that no one on god's green or snyder's nightmare earth would ever think not to press costing him nothing testing nothing proving nothing how exactly are you the best of the best not to mention that he joined the hero team not to make his dad proud not to do the right thing but because he didn't have friends i i need friends wait you you guys think this is better also what is this music no worries we're going to talk about the soundtrack too instead of running in a [ __ ] circle joss had him risking his life fighting monsters and saving people i will take meaningful action over this self-congratulatory garbage any day snyder had his chance and he [ __ ] blew it with essentially all the characters at this point and there was something for him to create here but he didn't go beyond a line or two in concept everyone is absolutely combing over this final scene when it's entirely spectacle it only happened because of how nonsensical poorly communicated and executed the plan was and the reversal of time being said to have repercussions but in reality does not this is like a job job job job his father is proud that he has a job job laugh my ass off this scene is just as terrible in the final cut as the first but like the scene looks awesome pity there's nothing in it and that's the kind of praise i have when this film is doing well for example he's my hero uh why why do you feel that way is there any insight to ghana here you know we could do this in a nanosecond right we could oh that's true and they don't answer that they just highlight it so you guys reckon this is a huge upgrade from the prior cut and you hate the other cut for this reason that's the plan okay we're not ready for racially charged um yeah that's cringy as hell for dialogue but you can't deny the flash is socially awkward he wants to make friends he thought this was a moment he's stared down by a black guy and says oh [ __ ] that's probably racially charged it's a fair mistake to make for someone like him it seems to line up we then get a fist bump at the end making it clear that he was mistaken and that they have a connection it's a tiny neat payoff meanwhile him saying superman is his hero is out of nowhere when does he ever mention that in any part of the meaningful scenes about his life and what inspires him why is superman significant to him correct me if i'm wrong but wouldn't this be your primary opportunity to explore the why behind it really missing superman right now uh no i meant like actually exploring it because this seems stapled on to me the flash doesn't seem to give the smallest of [ __ ] about clark specifically when his hero is resurrected returned to form and right next to him seems a little [ __ ] hollow manipulative not that it didn't work people are sucking that lion's dick everywhere i'd have wanted you know substance of any kind you can even have cyborg share something about himself and why don't they dig the grave super fast and what if anything can we do to connect these two characters even slightly because snyder's version ends after that line what did joss's do you know i could do this a lot faster i just is it weird that it feels disrespectful yep oh they're digging slowly because they feel uncomfortable digging up a fallen hero's grave um excellent you're struck by lightning a new explosion where the accidents yeah that's us oh that's like that's like actual substance they have camaraderie over being the accidental heroes would be a pity if someone cut that especially if they ended up keeping the fist bump because it's got no meaning behind it anymore beyond the surface so which do you honestly think handled those scenes better especially considering schneider had more time resources and freedom oh i'm sorry i missed something from the snyder cut what do you think man you think she'd ever go for a younger guy can't imagine why anyone would cut that but maybe you aren't convinced maybe you're sitting there stewing on the fact that this line was just so [ __ ] good that it painted a picture of flash for you that is unbreakable well let me ask you this would barry allen as presented in the snyder cut a man who is thoroughly inspired by superman not have a [ __ ] existential crisis when that same superman tries to beat him to death not only is there no introspection when having brushed so close to his own execution but the lessons he may have learned by looking up to clarke should now be in question he is seconds from being incinerated by his hero and we never hear him deal with this it changes nothing for him this is because the line is thrown in not for characterization or meaning but for masquerading as such i can only imagine joss would likely have cut this moment due to it being impossible to reconcile alongside his hero attempting to kill him with the time they had all style no substance that's something that's said for many creators but it's not more expertly represented than in snyder's products for instance why would the flash's shoes break apart but not his clothing in general how are his feet not [ __ ] wrecked here he's not wearing his suit and he's got human vulnerabilities do you know what it means for him to be dragging the concrete apart the visuals can be very neat the substantive details are broken his flash should be ground down to the bone against the concrete the flash is a glass cannon a normal man using the speed force yet he survives insane [ __ ] right here in the superman resurrection right here in the initial battle against steppenwolf right here when he's blasted by alien artillery right here when he charges into stone stairs breaking them apart and that doesn't even begin to cover the crazy levels of plot armor in this movie like mira being spared by steppenwolf over and over again when he has one specific job the amazonian queen was spared and cyborg escaped death because of all steppy picking him up this time when he could have taken his head off or maybe instead of chopping him in half he hits him with the body of the axe handle what the hell the glass on batman ship can't be broken through by steppenwolf after several punches but he can smash through the glass meant to contain 3.5 million kelvin in one lol superman doesn't kill any of the justice league but not for lack of trying he's simply only allowed to use execution moves when there's something in place that can save them like seriously had alfred's test failed here also what the [ __ ] are you doing testing it this way you crazy old bad bruce would have simply died like one of the braces explodes but the other one doesn't despite being blasted for longer and why does getting blasted across the way into a car do nothing to him it did in the other one imagine superman had killed them all might have changed the movie a bit not to mention darkseid not using his omega beams to insta-kill everyone here this [ __ ] is throughout by the way even the good stuff is splattered by snyder's idiotic goo as you guys probably remember i paid some compliments to cyborg and silas near the beginning but that's only as far as not including everything that damages their character choices and the reality of the plot lines they're a part of lots of which isn't included in the prior cut like the parademon showing up to the house to explain it coming in later when we knew that was something they did regardless at the very least it wouldn't stop it for more than five minutes and what were the odds of the parademon coming to have a look at the very moment a cop car drove past the creature is solely focused on finding the box do you really think it's gonna care about a cop car these are normal and amateur cause-and-effect fuck-ups sure but most importantly why would cyborg not warn his father about this and protect him from future parademon visits he can send his father's phone messages at will he [ __ ] this up and his father is kidnapped as a result i would say it's a drastic improvement to remove this scene entirely in the jost cut this functions as a supported surprise not a setup certainly not one that breaks a character and to be honest with you silas should have figured this out already from the previous break-in but everybody is stupid in this universe and what more can be said about silas outside of him somehow not seeing or hearing this [ __ ] ahead of time well had he provided the motherbox to the league he would have saved the day because allowing them to track it means they have the chance to get it back but you could have given it to them now especially when it means the end of the world that's on top of the fact that he never would have had this idea if not for the laser apparently being a viable option as of [ __ ] yesterday as if this movie needed more contrivance that comboed with a myriad of holes and stretches allows the film to happen in the first place i said he was a good actor and he is but this film is filled with horrible acting we've made some real progress let me show you you're right dr stone the test came back negative everyone's clear including you do you think batman is connected to the object you're looking at the hottest thing on earth exact words i said to my prom date she dumped me anyway yeah why is wonder woman looking like she's seen the [ __ ] bus roll in this is darkseid woman this is the future you are most terrified of the war that you were warning people about can you please for once in your screen time look like you care no that was a [ __ ] retake by the way no gal gadot's acting is such a meme that they tried to fix this particular reading with a re-recording and it still sounds like ass no and i've not even covered her narration for the wall flashback holy [ __ ] dark side was met in battle by earth's defenders the old gods men atlanteans before their oh and a whole bunch of those examples were cut in the joss version yet we're definitely worse for it huh yeah so what about aquaman well he's aquaman he basically spends the whole movie being a cool guy who does cool things oh maybe you think that's unfair since i took that clip from justice league i've seen people bumbling across the internet to argue that all of the cringe was whedon's of course because snyder's much more mature so let's play his version shall we oh that's weird the gesture is in there but there's no sound i guess snyder never recorded aquaman doing the cringy because he is of a higher caliber but wait if we check out the original trailers airing before joss was even connected to the project what does one discover oh i guess he saw fans complain about it as terrible weed and cringe in 2017 and so decided to exit they wouldn't be proof of other things like that would they it's good to see you playing well with others again just like a bat i dig it maybe temporary oh boy and everyone was sure that was whedon we lost a jk simmons scene just to avoid the cringe i hear you can talk to fish [Music] even the fish joke was originally snyder guys you have to understand snyder was the cringe all along he just wanted you to think that his version was entirely dissimilar when in reality he was the driving force behind so much of what makes it fall the [ __ ] apart for instance this whole shot in imax and preserving a 4x3 adjacent aspect ratio he didn't intend to do that when filming you can see that from so many shot comparisons to the trailer back in 2016 red letter media have shown this as well what they haven't shown is that the headspace when looking at shots for what snyder would have created from scratch after the deal was made is a bit different look how everyone is framed in the nightmare scenes or the bonus steppenwolf scenes look at darkseid's final scene no awkward headspace [ __ ] there he shot this originally intending to cut it to size only he began claiming it's his vision to help distance it from the weed and cut as much as possible which also explains the black and white and the bloated run time even superman's suit wasn't going to be black at first guys and if you want to claim he's changed his vision retroactively then we need to have a chat about words retaining meaning he tried anything and everything within his power to separate these two cuts but enough about that back on with aquaman he's barely a character he talks about not wanting to be king finding most people as selfish and superstitious this is something we get in bonus willem dafoe scenes but we already had it in the joss cut this is just bloat he's sort of dragged along because he's told he has to a mother box our people god is not safe the time has come take up your mother's pride somehow it's only his responsibility to save the world then why the hell did you even bother defending this stupid box in the first place your mother left you to save your life it would have been her responsibility to follow that monster to the surface and stop him now it's yours what you guys aren't going to do anything this [ __ ] is about to end the world and because of tradition you're sending one guy to hopefully stop him is this a [ __ ] joke why are the amazonians and the atlanteans so god damn useless is it because their involvement might have ended the plot too quickly okay i guess that's good writing regardless like i said he's essentially pushed into doing stuff man imagine finding out more from arthur how he feels about the situation what his ideas on it are imagine a bonus scene in the movie that gives you more insight to what he feels we're with you till it's done honestly i think we're all going to be dead way before that it's an honorable end but we got to shut stepping wolf down i know we went to war with the amazons but that was before my time you know what i don't want to die i'm young there's [ __ ] that i want to do i've been alone in my whole life being part of something bigger like this this tells us something about him whether cringy or not snyder bizarrely tries to have him generate some drama with cyborg where he believes he might be working for the enemy well you know a lot about these boxes makes you think you know you're trying to say something oh i'm saying it how do we know you're not working for them did they forget that aquaman knows cyborg rescued all of the people steppenwolf wanted do they remember that aquaman knows he saved the justice league from drowning he's provided the main item the enemies want to this group himself is this just a random line to make it seem as though there's drama because a successful film did that as well his father's dead because of us no aquaman his dad made a choice that actually kind of screwed you guys over while also potentially ending the world not to mention being something that cyborg himself could have prevented but oh well in the joss whedon cut aquaman is like really mean to victor for no reason he's kind of like a jerk overall and it never gets resolved but in this one he's sympathetic to victor and he talks about how he feels bad for him and they're kind of bros see you can't find them or maybe you don't want to man i'm not doing this on purpose right because you can't control the machine we're asking a kid who just lost his father to go up against the most powerful machines in the universe it's not fair i thought you didn't care i never said that this is a completely different relationship now wait what that's not true at all aquaman was a dick to cyborg in the snyder cut you know a lot about these boxes makes you think how do we know you're not working for them and that one actually made no sense because cyborg had done nothing but support the team snyder had aquaman say it to prompt the history lesson about the box and cyborg's construction there's no apology for that it's dropped entirely not to mention aquaman's commentary on silas is inaccurate to the situation and against what we know aquaman would say about a man having prevented the league from saving the world he should be pissed that silas stole the box but the thing is you're wrong twice over the joss cut removed the alternative silas plotline he's alive by the end you can't have aquaman saying cyborg is going up against the boxes when his father died that wouldn't make any sense so of course this line is dropped secondly aquaman has a fantastic [ __ ] reason to be pissed at victor in justice league they all do his suit malfunction his inability to control the machine might have just cost them the entire world how would it be unreasonable to be angry in that situation not to mention that when we hit the final fight aquaman has clearly come around to cyborg and they combo up other than that aquaman says all right and mama while drinking and seeming like he doesn't care just like the rest of the original cut because zach didn't do anything for arthur curry in fact he [ __ ] with aquaman are you aware that the atlanteans can speak to each other underwater zack it's true the half-breed wields king atlanta's trident he commands the sea then that half breed is your king they don't do these weird fish noises [Music] are you aware that only the royal blooded people can survive out of water that the normies and the guards they have to have suits to survive you seem to forget this for the entire scene of pulling atlanteans out of the ocean showing the entire drag the drop the interrogation that was already set up by willem dafoe guards never stronghold have been disappearing snatches from above talk to king yet you show it and you show the questions steppenwolf asks then throwing the dude about then using a spider to get the answers he wants after splitting his skull steppenwolf is a smart boy so you already had a scene set for why steppenwolf could get to the mother boxes they call to him you've shown he can teleport in so that's fine then you add atlanteans were being abducted and interrogated you don't need this and then you showed that happening you also don't need this then you made the entire scene redundant twice over because he has a device to do that for him but you didn't even need that if only someone could have cut all of that fat out of the movie falco told me you would come the first born of beloved queen atlanta are you aware of the [ __ ] accent mira has in aquaman she's not british he's a short-sighted is he is cruel since before the sahara was a desert thank you for repeating what i just said it's completely dried out i knew her next one of us my parents died in the wars she took me no they [ __ ] didn't your father is actually pivotal to the aquaman storyline did you [ __ ] forget this james wan considers aquaman a sequel to the snyder cut so why is it that joss actually cut this out and replaced it to make it match aquaman more i knew her that makes one of us when my parents fought in the wars she took me this is getting a little weird isn't it whedon didn't just add adr lines to improve continuity he made the people in these films more human [Music] did he just bail this guy's still bothering you civilians we gotta pull these things apart couple more seconds you'll see your opening i think we could take it good so i really like being alive clark i take it back i want to die oh my god it's like the first time superman actually had a proper [ __ ] laugh in this dismal tormented universe but i'm also a big fan of justice [ __ ] yes i will take this cheesy ass line over watching nightmare superman slice body parts off screaming enemies while firing his laser at innocent people you are welcome to prefer otherwise how about we compare the goobers we have families why does everyone keep telling me whedon steppenwolf is so committed to the evil bad guy trope that he's baffled by the idea of appealing to a family as a reason to spare a life it's pretty damn cheesy plenty to have fun with please we have families then you have weakness uh wait a minute isn't your entire thing in this movie to get back to your demon alien family under the wing of daddy darkseid also that line is pretty damn edgy make of them what you will though i think it's worth highlighting that in snyder's version the justice league simply arrive and see silas is in trouble whedon's has a quick pan before that showing silas still wears his wedding ring comboed up with his expression bolstering his connection to his family in what would be a drastic situation probably would have been worth keeping that in one of the last shots of the league staring out into the world joss has them looking at life returning to this evil villain base obviously on point with the vibe of the film similarly zack gave a suitable visual that meshes with his vision a murky decrepit smoke-laden wasteland i think it's clear that joss was trying to make repairs and in regard to the characters of aquaman volkow and mira seem to be very invested in the motherbox they even turn up at the end to congratulate arthur i like how he locks arms with willem dafoe as if these guys did [ __ ] anything the aquaman stuff is a lot like the batman stuff and the flash stuff and the wonder woman stuff you know worse in the snyder cut cyborg has more flesh but he also has a metric ton more [ __ ] ups then we have the amazon queen lois mirra martha lex vulco darkseid sort of like none of them are characterized beyond their function in the plot even the meaningful martha lowest scene didn't have martha in it apparently the martian manhunter was very invested in getting lois back on track to being a [ __ ] journalist you haven't been to work since clark died i can't there is something you can do for me honey come back to the living this man seriously needs to reevaluate what he's invested in but more to the point why pretend to be martha instead of talking to her as the general that she has a relationship with especially since if she references this discussion in future she will realize someone [ __ ] with her you're going to scare both herself and martha for no reason the fact is he can go over her issues with clarke's death not necessarily superman's he can talk about her work and give her encouragement instead he now risks everyone seeing him go in as the general or martha and leaving as the opposite or the same and have everyone questioning just what the [ __ ] is happening for the general to be there but he also turns into the martian for a moment in the apartment building for no reason at all why risk getting caught is it just to make fans cream their pants at their favorite comic book guy man if only there was a cut that kept the substance of this scene maintained the characters involved and removed the martian element considering how redundant it was hmm i honestly think it shouldn't go understated that this meaningful discussion and connection between clark's mother and clark's love interest is removed for no other reason than bait it's also sad to know that bruce didn't help out superman's mother with her house especially after the moment they shared but whatever everyone sucks in this universe speaking of which the villains ladies and gentlemen darkseid wants to take over the world running exclusively on nostalgia for fans because nothing of substance comes out of him except i'm evil at least we have steppenwolf right what was his motivation again well unlike the justice cut where he was a powerful entity looking to facilitate the unity and ascend to godhood as a reprieve from his exile conquering the earth in the process he is now a powerful guy looking to conquer the earth for darkseid because he betrayed him once that was worth the extra eight scenes of steppenwolf it's certainly worth the two hours what the [ __ ] is wrong with you people praising this addition as if steppenwolf is incredibly strong as a character now he simply works for someone who has the exact same motivation as steppenwolf from joss's cut do you guys even remember the theatrical version and what level of subtlety was used to get this motivation across to the audience i wonder steppenwolf who might have sat here by the side of the great one desired let me make a plea to him that i may come home oh they just start discussing his core motivation mighty steppenwolf undone by his self pride let me make a plea to him you betrayed him i saw my mistake i slaughtered those who sought his throne like wow they just lay out everything both of them already know for the sake of the audience he will see my worth again this is considered to be a strong addition you still oh the great one 50 000 more worlds wait what 50 000 planets how the [ __ ] is he gonna do that what the villains in this film have been proven to be [ __ ] already from everything they forget alongside their multiple opportunities through both the boom tube and the big old portal device to invade earth at its weakest with their armies after establishing the planet has everything they want and they see steppenwolf has almost won but they do nothing not even elizabeth warren has the balls to get in there and make a difference hey remember the big fight why didn't he just set down in the middle of some random island to commit the unity it literally burns the earth and gives him control over the inhabitants it sounds pretty useful dude why go to a place where all of the armies are going to meet you nearly all of them are landlocked you stupid [ __ ] the atlanteans are gonna be way too slow to catch up to you and you can blast them with your giant fuck-off spaceships maybe you lost the fight because you put your gimpy defenseless copy-pasted sorcerers in the center of the battlefield doing [ __ ] nothing only to be killed by a normal ass arrow imagine he put them behind his ships and protected them in fact how did they know you were coming here it all has to be figured out in the modern day did you warn them ah you didn't have to set down here darkseid this is [ __ ] embarrassing man maybe a cut where you remove all of the dark side scenes all of the bonus steppenwolf scenes and the additional nonsense world building could be made maybe that would give the story more coherency who knows what we do know is that dialogue for steppenwolf was terrible and the movie is filled with it because zack is terrible at dialogue no man in the sky intervened when i was a boy to deliver me from daddy's fists and abominations not to mention the dceu is pretty terrible at dialogue handsome but like you know what are the examples who are you the lasso of hestia compels you to reveal the truth why the [ __ ] would you explain what your truth lasso does to this man when you're trying to find out everything you can as quickly as you can to save people's lives his personal knowledge of the lasso's function makes no difference he will tell the truth regardless was all this because you can't write expository dialogue as i talked to my father who's still in prison for the murder of my mother which he didn't commit how did i get interested in criminal justice i can't remember i am a drag on your life wow isn't it convenient that the first time we see this significant background character from barry's life they spill out all of the important details about both their characters and what they both want i want you to listen to me because i mean this i want you to give all that up and i want you to stop coming to see me was all that because you can't write expository dialogue ryan shore director of nanotechnology that's your thing oh yep that's my thing wow why would that guy say it's your thing and then you repeat it's your thing ryan choi is it because that's a reference to the second atom is all that because you can't write expository dialogue who have you ever loved oh you said that to batman the guy who knows exactly what it's like to lose so many loves like a mother a father like an adopted son wow these lines are so good they just write themselves wish i was so talented as to point out that batman loved his parents you stupid [ __ ] i'm just so glad that we were able to fully understand exactly who these people are through their words and their actions not just expository dialogue we understand who these characters are by words and actions and not just expository dialogue [ __ ] hell brown table i was taking the piss how could you possibly think this you need me to help you undo this world you created by letting her die hey you know what criminal justice would be for me my son not wasting his life the dialogue is awful this one will be mine i belong to no one [Laughter] something is not working well oh [ __ ] down with the modern world back to the dark ages oh this lied it's so bad but like how do you even achieve this goal with blowing up four city blocks you get oh sorry that's your signal that means we have to go now yeah that's that's what that means it's so cool oh jeez i i need friends good god people thought that was a whedon reshoot who are you we're a small group of reactionary terrorists why when speaking the truth would they call themselves reactionary terrorists okay i hate atlanteans as much as you amazons do hate is useless hate is useless jesus christ besides who's gonna give you a reacharound oh god stop everyone is so quick to [ __ ] on josh's dialogue when snyder's is absolute dog [ __ ] at least the terrible mandated jokes were given a level of awareness snyder thinks this is glorious do you really think that oh wow they just they really just vanish huh oh that's rude oh look the joke where everyone is faster than the flash somehow i guess that wasn't a jost joke not fast enough to stop the rock that falls on top of people despite stopping the rest not fast enough to dodge the laser shot not fast enough to make his job interview and not fast enough to catch that everyone left around him not fast enough to outpace victor to the [ __ ] mother box what a great flash strong man as strong as alone you ever heard that ever hear a superman he died fighting next to me my point exactly so this isn't a saying it's zack's dialogue for sure but i mean it's certainly not true and man if it were me i would cut in a response to challenge it like i don't know bruce saying that's the opposite of what that's saying supposed to be that's not a saying that's the opposite of what the saying is oh joss did that and he managed to make it a superior scene despite chopping it down because he cut out this [ __ ] [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is this [Music] seriously was ben affleck just walking through these people hoping this will look and sound great in the end maybe that was the attitude for a lot of the movies since the soundtrack is pretty ass wouldn't you say for example zack decided we needed this track for walking upstairs wait a minute why the [ __ ] didn't you just cut this out they're walking upstairs dude could this film have some bloat hmm zach decided to use this song for the flash it's playing as he waddles to her rescue i can't did i dream you dreamed about me the [ __ ] lyrics just said did i dream you dreamed about me as he is grabbing a [ __ ] sausage in slow motion you can't make this up some of this [ __ ] comes out of nowhere you just end up pondering what the [ __ ] is wrong with the person making these decisions like this applies to changes too remember in whedon's how aquaman had his own awesome cool dude bro epic scene where he awesomed his way through the ocean well we got this track [Music] zach decided to change it to a different track um i don't i'm not really vibing with that [Music] oh i don't think that matches well remember wonder woman's theme the thing they play when she's about to commit a war crime [Music] well they do that in this with all the grace of a constipated magikarp but that ain't it for all wonder woman as if she needed more damage from this cut zach decided that her theme should be encompassed by a ghastly [ __ ] yodel every goddamn time she does [ __ ] anything listen to this inane horseshit [Music] shall we [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] this was so distracting that i struggled to think any human being on this planet failed to notice but music is good at manipulating an audience for instance what if superman's theme is played at several intervals [Music] sweetheart [Music] is this because it's earned no superman is in the same worthless dour state as he was in bvs oh that movie is ass cancer too by the way we got videos on the muller channel all about it links in the description oh my god again okay look at this batman hid under a rock now look what it does to everything else congratulations the s is a symbol it means hope you can make a choice they will join you a choice you will help them accomplish wonders all the hopes and dreams of krypton live in you now you gave hope to their world love them like i love you it's totally a choice though bridge the worlds burn the [ __ ] out of unborn children as a part of a civilization that had one chance to live again while crashing said container into metropolis because you're an awful person and you aren't held accountable also love them bridge them lofty meaningless dialogue to bring you back to the stage you were at not a movie prior which means superman was just on pause and then punching things while in his black suit and on top of that putting on the black suit had no [ __ ] story relevance at all it's literally done to make you like and share that cool thing you saw scoring points for doing nothing but referencing something you enjoy from something more substantive y'all are easily [ __ ] pleased oh boy look at these suits put it in the promos i beg you anything to tickle my balls lois is essentially superman's ragdoll hence the lack of commentary which means we need to talk more about superman isn't it pretty mortifying that superman's core confused state is that of killing anything and everything that seems like it could hurt him on top of being shown to go [ __ ] nuts and kill everyone once lois dies though it makes sense considering his characterization in man of steel gripton had his chance we talked about this what was i supposed to do just let them die maybe again most of the heroes in the dc eu are atrocity-inducing psychopaths though in terms of plot it's insane to me that so much pressure is placed on bringing him back to beat steppenwolf and save the world at the cost of activating the cube when they completely forget about the cube to focus on him and then forget about him to focus on the cube once again he is your ace in the hole you [ __ ] idiots you need to tell him the world is ending you probably should have opened with that or maybe you should have told lois to tell him like the end of the world is placed in the trusting hands of hopefully he shows up and he only does because he thinks they must have brought him back for something they wanted me back for a reason i need to find out why when they could have easily brought him back because he's superman and he died to save the world imagine he was satisfied with that being the answer the world [ __ ] ends imagine he took a day to recalibrate the world [ __ ] ends imagine he did turn up but he was too late because there was no rush the world [ __ ] ends they put no effort into finding him when everything rests on it they just hope you'll be here alfred i know it what makes you so sure what the [ __ ] is this dumbass line doing here they know he's with lois they know where he lived but nope they don't give a single [ __ ] to try and contact superman when he's the main hope of actually winning shut the [ __ ] up man if it were me i would likely do a reshoot where i have batman be the one to bring lois in to be busy sorting that out which like i said fixes some issues on its own and of course have him tell her what's happening so she can explain it to superman that's probably what i would do whether i was forced to record a bearded henry or not i have to send you away he needs you fate of the world i think that's the deal he was pretty tense well i guess i do all one anyone who thinks snyder's cut is more coherent than whedon's wasn't paying attention the funny part to me is the shitty dialogue the weird music choices the truncated pacing the awful special effects and generally ugly-ass color grading is explained by having a couple of months to completely alter a project under the stifling view of a desperate movie studio what the [ __ ] is your excuse oh hey that's a nice segue into the effects of this movie why do they have a shot of steppenwolf sneak at a peak like he does it for a bit and then they show it again i know that he wants to get his axe it's like he's a [ __ ] actor from l.a noire trying to remain non-suspicious it's just funny to me oh my god what the [ __ ] is this what is this stupid-ass bullet dance you have wonder woman doing look at this equally goopy ass glide superman's doing what the [ __ ] what look at this dude [Music] wait till you see them oh no no no no look at the top of his head like plenty looks solid but you don't have the excuse this time for stuff that's just downright hilarious please stop i can't handle it what what what what all right so if a significant portion of the cut is worse yet added in under half an hour and so many of the beneficial elements are equally tiny then where the hell is the time code going well how about some comparisons in the jost cut we learn that lex has escaped his bruce wayne facilitated imprisonment in arkham and it takes 31 seconds to get to deathstroke approaching lex from the beginning of the scene in the snyder cut we learn that lex has escaped his bruce wayne facilitated imprisonment in arkham and nothing additional outside of some cringe-worthy acting to get the same frame in 112 seconds that's almost four times as long to achieve nothing more that lex deathstroke scene is pretty amazing by the way payment comes in the form of batman's name being revealed as bruce wayne something deathstroke hasn't figured out for as much as 20 years despite it being tossed around with no regard for secrecy in as recent as this movie so let me get this straight you do dress like a bat like an actual bat dressed like a bat you're out of your mind bruce wayne worked for 20 years and got the fight comes we'll need you don't count on a batman all of these people are right [ __ ] there you [ __ ] sorry back on track let's look at a scene where the star labs janitor discovers the parademon in the joss cut we learn the janitor came across a parademon this sets up the missing people being interrogated about the box because it's not in star labs anymore but the scent is it takes 24 seconds in the snyder cut we learn that the star labs janitor came across a parademon this sets up the missing people being interrogated about the box for the same reason and it takes 71 seconds that's not including the bonus scenes that reaffirm this information on top of that it's already near four times as long how about the intro where the gunman are entering the building in joss's cut they enter go up the stairs and then get the people into the main room in the snyder cut we watch this man go from the bottom floor across the stairs up and around to the main room and it takes an extra 90 seconds zack even adds that they install a fake guard despite the obvious nature that a secret alarm would have been tripped and they want the police to know they are there they call them to witness this for [ __ ] sake we'll be making a statement shortly until then if i see any movement you'll have a lot of dead kids in your hands we have no demands we're just stalling the police while we're doing it well you do what these dramatic extensions that cause more problems are throughout the movie and i don't know seems a good idea to cuddle this [ __ ] bloat doesn't it also what the [ __ ] you see these guys exit the same van as this guy who went right by you and there's no concern about him is it literally because you didn't see a gun on him why would you assume they're not together okay how about scenes of visual splendor like the amazons firing the arrow of artemis to warn wonder woman joss takes 23 seconds to say that wonder woman will see the arrow light up on the building and war is on the way stupid but short snyder took 127 seconds to do that exact same thing only to then add scene after scene of wonder woman gallivanting in an ancient cave to unlock a stone door with this arrow and find out through carvings that darkseid got [ __ ] slapped and he's coming back maybe when the men bury the box the scene is over and done with in josh's version but zack feels the need to show us that they are definitely putting soil on that hole remember how superman's scream is waking up all of the boxes something that you could have a character say at a later point in your movie didn't call out to steppenwolf none of the boxes did not until not until superman died it's like they were afraid of him yes they were afraid of him which doesn't make much sense by the way but whatever how long do you think zack needed to visualize it 5 minutes and 22 seconds that doesn't account for the full intro by the way just the superman scream portion of it then there's the slo-mo so many [ __ ] shots in slow motion to try and justify this run time slow-mo on aquaman's rippling face slow-mo for so much of the action to make sure you absorb just what the [ __ ] is happening before you're hit with hilarity [ __ ] is self-indulgent to say the least and that's a criticism for every aspect of his filmmaking on display it insists upon itself lois he even [ __ ] the slow-mo up sometimes filming the women and slowing them down but failing to slow down the rubble when it's put in post at least joss can say he didn't have a slow-mo shot of a [ __ ] sesame seed slapping the camera it surprises me to the sum of zero that joss would have cut this [ __ ] seed out if you hadn't guessed it already i don't have a single [ __ ] issue with length it's bloat it's the inane waste of our finite lives that joss can actually spare you from in part you guys ever think about this scene where silas is dropped into the facility moved through and placed with other people ready for interrogation it's entirely bloat we know he was kidnapped and then we see him in the interrogation later it's just like the atlantean interrogation scene why include it if it's redundant and this is strictly from an information time argument if you want to argue for atmosphere films could be 10 billion years long perhaps next time we will watch this man climb stairs for 10 hours is this to bloat the film and get it as long as possible so that optically it seems entirely different from the original cut to further prove how the wb butchered it when in reality it's just a fat justice league with different colors and different jokes not to mention some [ __ ] stapled on and some better stuff removed because [ __ ] me zack you played the audience like a damn fiddle why do you think the trailer shows so many scenes that aren't in the weed and cut at all it's to convince you the entire film was different do you guys feel excited for the future do you feel like it was the substance that convinced you to get hype or was it the bait the pure unadulterated [ __ ] bait darkseid steppenwolf boxes deathstroke lex is back joker dissod elizabeth warren nightmare [ __ ] the justice league table cyborg movie flash movie wonder woman movie rebuilding wayne manor batman solo movie justice league 2 nightmare movie wonder woman prequel movie why did zach dress wonder woman like a [ __ ] dracula the bat tank oh that was a [ __ ] worthwhile payoff wasn't it this is mystery box [ __ ] guys this is jj's [ __ ] forte it's literally what they plastered in the promo [ __ ] you [ __ ] fools how about the ice breath that [ __ ] came out of nowhere probably would have been useful in several occasions across this entire mangled franchise and it relies on a third-party knowledge of superman because this [ __ ] is insane for a new viewer but if you are aware of past properties it might just give your balls that extra tickle assuming you aren't too busy reconciling morose mass murder man with actual superman this isn't a joke you can't murder people and call yourselves heroes superman is almost normal again that's good more movies to come oh and look martian manhunter hopefully he gets a movie too oh and some they've called me the martian manhunter wait but wouldn't you rather be known by your name and who my good man [ __ ] who calls you that also why would you think describing yourself as a man hunter alien would come across as friendly to a superhero with no context especially this superhero who the [ __ ] talks like this unless they're creating a promo to manipulate fans oh and you know what we haven't really spoken on his scene yet the scene where he comes down to bruce and explains that he's invested in helping he has seen people come together and it's given him new hope and a stake in the world when we know he had a stake in it already how do we know you won't one day act against america's interests he has actively tried to save the world on a regular basis in his human persona and he's already seen the team up in bvs oh i'm sorry where the [ __ ] were you in each of the three world ending events you cuck why are you turning up once everything ended with each of zod doomsday and steppenwolf defeated [ __ ] cowardice is what that is i'm sure you're not going to tell me that he was added later in production to bait fans too surely not surely bruce doesn't look thinner and older because this was shot well past original filming dates and surely making martha the martian man hunter in this scene wasn't an attempt to avoid looking like this was all dropped at once right it honestly wouldn't surprise me if the martian manhunter brew scene was tacked on and zack felt they'd already tacked on the fan baiting joker nightmare sequence so he needed to justify this one a bit better leading him to take the martha scene and make it a martian manhunter scene to establish him beforehand to make the end look less [ __ ] blatant in terms of the manipulation oh boy that would be cheap right to use the fans that way i shot uh martian manhunter um the shot of harry lennox that a shot i didn't have of him leaving martha's apartment yeah i shot it right down uh right in the right down in the driveway zach just wants more movies he wants to slam his 100 million dollar action figures together again and again and he knows how to garner support for it it's all manipulation joker was marketed as having new and important scenes but not only does he lose his trailer dialogue in the final cut he only shows up in a [ __ ] dream to offer a reach around i wasn't cheating i wasn't doing like oh you broke the rules like dropping this promotional [ __ ] that doesn't appear in the movie probably because jared leto shot this for his private collection i am not someone who is love i suppose that would explain the nightmare sequence wouldn't it a scene that was clearly shot well after 2017 specifically to make it seem as though there's way more of a plan to have the entire conversation bait the deaths of characters the arrival of characters and the tumultuous end of the justice league it's all bait oh boy recycling footage just to get people to push for you to have your sequels because your shitty movies could never stand on their own you have to bait sequels and a franchise because you are the mcu without the substance think on that as a statement justice league being this almost base plate of a story created by zack with two creators coming in to tweak it according to their respective preferences resulting in two cuts one being given every limit under the sun from tonal to length requirements to not even having the script controllable to begin with to the other being given full control a ton of money freedom and access to actors that would be rare for most on top of that the most important element provided that accentuates every other one is time time to craft his vision specifically something the other did not have i know that people are absolutely loving the snyder cut right now but i've never been one to go with the flow so let's summarize the characters have been butchered through thorough incompetence far further than joss's depressing attempt at recovery none of them behave with a shred of intelligence throughout the story there is so little concern mechanically and ethically for the prospect of bringing superman back which is unacceptable and softens the significance of the event for this story but that was clearly already the case in terms of henry's screen time meanwhile joss had him say a bunch and he referenced pet cemetery doomsday and has wonder woman pushing back hard with batman pushing for the resurrection fueled by his guilt giving bruce and clark something to bond over when he returns compare that to aquaman raising a small unheard alarm right before it happens along with cyborg who panics on seeing an apocalyptic vision of the future of which he never addresses almost as though the visuals were bait what a shame lex's journey from psychotic to coherent was skipped for the audience not that he was particularly engaging to begin with [Music] the red capes are coming the red capes are coming shut the [ __ ] up it would seem victor is being praised and he's falling the [ __ ] apart outside of every complaint i have for his story in a logical sense relating to the man he is the ethical questions are daunting and only a man-child like zach could give the power to destroy the world to a teenager and forget to interrogate the implications silas is a [ __ ] crazy man and he's responsible for the generation and operation of this power we're all at your mercy vic everyone's lives are controlled by complex digital networks that will bend without effort to your will it's not only insane for him to comprehend that it's wrong for anyone to have that power it's what we're trying to prevent darkseid from doing you idiots the free will must be ripped from them given absolution in one glorious belief to serve him bend without effort to your will a free will must be ripped from them the film is not ready for this conversation the craziest part is that the one time he could use this newfound unethical incredible connection to save the world he doesn't batman has to instead it is the burden of this responsibility that will define you and who you choose to be that's true but we don't see it he helps one person and unfortunately he probably destroyed her life the implications and consequences of his actions are so much more interesting when he's also so naive about the world this is prime real estate for a fantastic story it could be so tragic while at the same time being so uplifting none of that is seen or explored in a meaningful way none of it is internalized instead we get [ __ ] like this [ __ ] the world because this film is as vast as a long boring brown ocean and as deep as a droplet you had four hours and you couldn't even make the accident multi-layered it's just a standard car crash apparently you rely on them did it strike anyone else's odd that when batman is recruiting he's willing to throw a [ __ ] batarang at someone in hopes of seeing what powers they have you're the batman so you're fast are you [ __ ] kidding me you have no idea how his powers work you don't know if you caught him off guard or if he has to charge something or if he needs special shoes or if he needs particular gear like you do you could have straight up [ __ ] killed him because you're a [ __ ] all of these sorts of things are very indicative of character like there's this weird bit where batman [ __ ] kicks a bug down a hole and it splats because you know for some reason it doesn't use its [ __ ] wings batman is watching this marveling at it giving us the full wiley coyote treatment while [ __ ] steppenwolf is right there in front of him attempting to kill his teammate why is everyone so blissfully moronic like flash though at least whedon actually had flash do something in this movie unlike snyder in the final battle flash is running in a circle until he hits the automatic win button built on nonsense whedon had him killing enemies and saving a family you're going in circles man that's awful not to mention this payoff being entirely at odds with the idea that the flash had to loop for [ __ ] ages to earn the charge for cyborg here he's completely reset and then he runs for what seems like half a single loop and apparently he's all good that's satisfying in the prior battle snyder had him giving a morale boost to civilians while they climbed stairs in whedon's the flash was saving people personally he didn't even have time to ignore his teammates while they're attacked in front of him and in whedon's the flash was scared this is early in his career and he's only ever pushed people around this helps nerf him because he should be dominating these battles it's not preferable but it helps explain why we get to have battles that include the whole team and he gets to the point of ripping the bugs apart personally by the final fight in snyder's he was given a whole extra scene that's entirely embarrassing [ __ ] and no nerf making things fall apart even more how the [ __ ] do people think snyder handled this better for [ __ ] hours and the characters are almost as thin if not thinner than a two-hour cut how the [ __ ] does that happen especially when the answer to me was as simple as having darkseid's parademons flood in through a boom tube for flash to deal with pushing him to his limits as he wipes through as many as hundreds of them as they try to reach cyborg this could surprise darkseid explaining that he did indeed send reinforcements but he didn't expect them to get this kind of pushback not a fix but a tweak that could alleviate two issues at once it's a weird disaster she legit gives the sweater a big ol sniff snyder's vision the bad guys aren't any better of course steppenwolf has an extremely thin background entirely overshadowed by papa darkseid who essentially just is what the mcu fans feared thanos would be in infinity war and kind of became an endgame you know i'm evil because i'm evil and all of existence shall be mine god these villains suck i told you steppenwolf would fail that's pretty rich coming from the guy among trillions including darkseid who forgot a [ __ ] planet you guys stood there and watched him battle six super powered superheroes including a [ __ ] kryptonian and you're surprised he lost even though it's worth mentioning that a planet lacks a kryptonian when trying to conquer it no protectors here no lanterns you lot are absolutely useless you could have taken earth you could have had everything you wanted but you blew it you had it all and you blew it actually wait a second are you suggesting that if a kryptonian were here you would have left because you clearly can't fight one in fact you probably should have portaled out of there when he arrived like your more intelligent predecessor on that note cyborg and silas weren't the only numpties in the laser sequence steppenwolf chose to awkwardly move through this doorway instead of blasting through right to the mother box which if he simply grabbed without a concern for silas this is another way he might have survived ironic hey the hallways in this place are kind of human-ready steppenwolf wasn't smashing through all the walls so did he do like a little goomby crab walk in order to get in here because [ __ ] hellbait that is something i would absolutely pay to see but still i'm confused superman is basically a kryptonian anomaly not only are kryptonians essentially extinct superman is the only one to reach this power level unless you count zod these guys are gonna be piss-easy for someone like steppenwolf when they aren't powered up which only really happened with clark wait a minute are you telling me that the only planet to have a juiced up kryptonian defender is the only planet with the old gods and the only planet with the anti-life equation and the only planet to have beaten dark side back irrelevant of the kryptonian the first time what a calamitous cosmic coincidence batman not to mention that you could have had that stupid equation for millennia but you forgot a [ __ ] planet how embarrassing and on that note master yoda how does a space-faring multiverse traveling culture get btf-owed by an army of medieval [ __ ] at least whedon had the chad steppenwolf pulled away from the fight after showing strong resistance to the gods because his battle was lost snyder had the virgin dark side suffer insane damage bleeding the [ __ ] out and crawling away to be carried onto his ship while he fainted from the pressure this is your main villain do i even need to sight marvel you worthless [ __ ] darkseid only survived because ares got distracted this loss was brought upon him because the enemy planet did the unthinkable they defended themselves thanos [ __ ] relished the competition [Music] let him have his fun like do you understand what's happening here the big bads big bad boss almost died to the guy that wonder woman killed ages ago even thanos's defeat was infinitely more dignified than darkseid's life he's pathetic steppenwolf looks like a five-year-old tried to draw suit of armor the bugs are worthless and the two subordinates are just bait for the future but what an epic [ __ ] battle am i right they did what no other world in the multiverse could do hit him with an axe not gonna lie this fight was easy as [ __ ] and i'm embarrassed for the people who expected more than what we saw in joss's version you guys got [ __ ] your very first appearance of the dc big bad and he got completely cucked also somehow steppenwolf combined with darkseid put up less of a fight than zod's [ __ ] henchman go home you absolute losers oh and then there's the plot chugging along with all the fortitude of a dead whale on a desert in space i don't know if you've grasped it yet but no scene in this wreck is running on cause and effect no scene could make sense to save its life it's all incredibly convenient and impossible to boot relax alfred i'll take it from you uh do i know you batman went out with the team patched them in but didn't introduce cyborg to alfred okay wonder woman didn't tell alfred about cyborg after their meeting you would need them all to be patched in for this [ __ ] job all of this stupid [ __ ] to tell a thin joke for [ __ ] sake though it's also pretty [ __ ] that cyborg would have missed this rendezvous and all of them would have died if not for his father being kidnapped that very night leading him to want to find them by looking into the right patch of sky on the right day at the right time why does silas know everything there is to know about cyborg's alien motherbox induced capabilities seems like fully understanding all of this information should be just a tad out of his reach nice and convenient for victor to learn about though why does cyborg need a charge to get into the mother boxes at all instead of simply connecting as a mother box created person why choose to write it that way is it because snyder had to get rid of the flash for the fight because he's too powerful only to then drop an entirely hollow payoff on him to distract the viewer from the fact that you prevented the flash from doing anything in this movie who knows aquaman is told the motherbox needs protecting and had he been told any later or maybe saved more random fishermen or taken one extra drink at the bar before heading over there meera would have straight up died pretty convenient for a different film's existence how about the fact that the bat carrier ship is given dramatic significance in terms of getting batman and the team to the enemy lair but in both versions is destroyed after the spire is sufficiently damaged in snyder's version it just turns back up to take them home what the [ __ ] happened there surely a cut where they simply look upon their victory and their return home is left ambiguous would be superior did anyone make that cut oh did you guys see the absolutely abominable formations of their armies both good and bad at least end game has a partial excuse of rushing a bunch of dusted people into battle this is three prepped and civilized factions previously having fought wars against a solid unit and they all flail across the battlefield i hope shad doesn't see this also why did they decide to keep the cubes on earth diana said they fought with warriors from the stars [ __ ] take these ridiculously overpowered horrifying monster boxes away so that darkseid can't reconnect them so easily for [ __ ] sake and is the equation really a bunch of symbols on the floor how in the holy [ __ ] does this translate to taking the will of the universe why the [ __ ] even ask inconsistent mother boxes everyone forgetting about them and i mean every single [ __ ] person who knew about this great war in darkseid's army that desad said everyone knows well absolute horseshit 3.5 billion kelvin the suits malfunction silas's decisions and sacrifice cyborgs major gaps in knowledge and action no missiles from cyborg the plot armor the luck a giant middle finger to aquaman the final plan is insane compared to what they could do and it almost fails in a million ways because our team is as [ __ ] as ever only to work because time travel is fine which brings us to the world building in which our wonderful plot and characters house themselves a world with consequences time travel mata reconstruction full military control resurrection worthless civilizations will let each other die even if it means their own people's destruction embarrassing villainous factions and infinite teleports man what more can they do to destroy the stakes you remember how steppenwolf is shown to be hit here he then gets frozen off screen for two minutes until this happens that kinda reminds me of a lot of the shitty editing throughout this movie look at the scene here with ryan choi he just blips forward because someone [ __ ] up when binding these two shots together there's so many examples of these little flourishes throughout so many times that people are off screen and therefore we don't concern ourselves with them not to mention how much [ __ ] was left in the cut zak where did you learn to edit so the characters have been [ __ ] the editing is [ __ ] the soundtrack is disjointed if not horrible the aspect ratio black and white [ __ ] bloat slow-mo and marketing were entirely constructed to trick people into thinking this was a meaningfully different and better movie the effects make me question things like why was zack trying to rip off linkin park when creating his motherbox world you know special effects have gotten better since then and that's not mentioning the dialogue that makes good normal friendly wholesome regular everyday people reconsider the first amendment but how do we tie this all off how about the theme of being stronger together united as one to defeat the hardships life throws at us only most of the team are pushed along by their respective civilizations doing nothing to help them in the first place take up your mother's mothers uniting because they kind of live on earth and don't want it destroyed when considering why each character joins the team in this film they essentially blur together so little is done for them as people that when we finally see them fight as a team in all of their glory you aren't thinking about how far we've come rather you wonder where we came from it's even worse on the world stage the amazonians don't help because they forgot that they figured out travel beyond their borders not that it's surprising these are the same psychopaths that drown their own people trying to cage someone who can teleport at least when someone is chasing you with that ability it's better you put objects in their way forcing them to decide on cutting through them or teleporting because it buys you precious seconds taking all of that time to drown your own people in an attempt to annoy this creature is deranged and you should be sectioned after serving a [ __ ] jail sentence if only someone cut that bit out the atlanteans don't want to help because they're busy knocking out rebels instead of dealing with the end of the world and what about man man doesn't know this is happening with our team being absolutely useless when being combined and put against superman you quickly realize that zack snyder's justice league is superman what the [ __ ] is any villain going to do against him unless he turns evil we have the theme of uniting together for our true strength smashed to pieces by showing the three significant races of earth failing to join together against the darkness through stupidity ignorance and a petty concern for power with one man we all look to to get us through the dark times perhaps that's more poignant in a depressing way regardless what a fantastic story for real though let's talk improvements uh the weird fish cult they they didn't eat bruce there was based alfred teaching an alleged actress how to brew tea properly he even had some cool lines i had a dollar for every possibly yeah make you even more insufferable he's probably the only thing i can enjoy in this dark abyss of a universe in the opening snyder had bruce attempting to assemble the team regardless of an explicit threat which is in line with bvs whedon screws this up and has bruce assembling them because a bug splattered his box graffiti all over a wall after having been shot with a net no [ __ ] clue what anyone was thinking with this gotham looked pretty neat though also i was curious when watching the original justice league because i figured they could just destroy them other boxes and nobody addressed it but then in snyder's version they did why don't we just destroy it fire doesn't destroy the boxes they're an unknown form of matter and they love heat they absorb it these improvements are worth 70 million dollars now that the mother boxes have been destroyed how will you retrieve your great prize wait destroyed i thought you were separating them back into three i want to plug into the unity one-on-one fuse with that weakness bound from the inside so we can break it back into three um the mother boxes have been destroyed okay i don't understand at all how about based alfred firing an alien laser gun at his new invention in his lab though that was pretty [ __ ] cyborg had some extra stuff that was good it's mod and extra [ __ ] though so i don't know how much it's worth it also cost two more hours uh based alfred got to speak to superman but that really didn't have anything in it i think there's more but i can't remember jeremy irons was pretty cool the fact is the core team is a crumbling mess of idiotic creepy ignorant psychopathic and ego driven monsters caught between a myriad of movies representing them in ways that absolutely wishes to piss all over what you understand about them the disrespect is through the roof fans of the comics must be furious they dangle what you want but snatch it away while revealing they don't give a [ __ ] in the process i'll bet you want to see the nightmare sequence don't you cause it'll be cool well be ready to spend it with this psychopath no no the other one please stop being oh man clark carries himself the exact same way superman does there's not actually a difference between them that's odd you're not even wearing the glasses there buddy that's it's okay it's fine our boy is gonna be a-okay he's soon to have a new adoptive father and darkseid is only marginally worse than his previous dad maybe batman is given no respect from [ __ ] anyone throughout despite being the absolute lad that keeps it all together how did you get the house back from the bank [Music] i bought the bank wait what just buy the house you [ __ ] weirdo the mother boxes had humble beginnings once upon a time to now be eldritch demons because zack is an edgy boy aquaman is unrecognizable superman viciously lasered off a portion of steppenwolf's head but i suppose that's nothing compared to his neutral state of murder everything the horn lasering thing is especially weird with wonder woman right there she never tries to string up steppenwolf with her lasso you could get information out of him you could easily subdue him i mean think of the way you can combo it up with your team it worked on [ __ ] doomsday it would very likely work on [ __ ] superman but she only gives it the one try you should really use that noggin of yours and try this a second time diana this prevents him from further punching your friends while reminding him that he shouldn't kill innocent people as part of a rampage because that's the level we're at with this superman sorry i'm getting distracted from telling you how they [ __ ] up superman by going into how they [ __ ] up wonder woman again so superman the psychotic snyder version almost executed the flash i need you to absorb that he was stopped by a brave [ __ ] soldier trying to distract him long enough to save the superhero only to be provided a death laser pretty sure this gunner is dead pretty sure batman is dead that laser didn't just hit his gauntlets what's far more important is that this absolute [ __ ] is never addressed by superman or the league superman uses his bloody laser against the justice league and innocent people more than he did against invading world ending aliens who wrote this he's very likely obliterated an innocent man for trying to save the flash and who knows how many people would be dead if not for lois happening by holy [ __ ] what if her final visit was yesterday martian manhunter almost convinced her to go back to work had his goal been achieved and she stopped visiting clark's statue instead of doing it one last time superman would have [ __ ] killed everyone what the [ __ ] is your motivation you absolute jimmy neutron reject like i figure i don't need to say it but wonder woman and superman were both assassinated in this movie whether you use comics or prior movies as a reference she punched a guy into a group of children and then compensated by hitting him back like a ping-pong ball into the wall to splatter his brains in front of them all similarly superman is [ __ ] broken which is doubly unfortunate because he's barely a character in this film to begin with yet another bait and switch for all of you out there cyborg failed to use the tools at his disposal that gave him the chance to become a superhero but fundamentally in both versions they failed to create a character that is congruent with his emotional state we are told he hates his life and his body but we aren't shown a meaningful reason why in both films there is no physical suffering while operating as cyborg there are no significant references to a longing for his squishy human body parts there was no overwhelming frustration or confusion relating to the sheer amount of information coursing through his head there was no lamentation on a career in the sporting world having been cut short there was no knowledge or representation that he can never interact in the normal world without being seen as an other there are simply surface level references to him believing he's a monster in fact he shows us how incredible his abilities are how much he is now capable of only to then complain about being alive whining that he is a monster when as an audience you can only guess where the issue lies and you simply wait for him to say that this is clearly better than being dead his story had major potential instead we raise a bored eyebrow and listen to some choice dialogue [ __ ] the world he almost allowed the world to burn to a crisp without doing what he could to stop it and he let his father die which i guess gives him a kinship with superman so there's that [Music] maybe at least homelander pretends to be a hero [ __ ] hell you know for those who still aren't convinced joss tried to give a throwaway line to explain it no this world needs you the world needs you [Music] the idea that superman's memory was coming back in pieces that this resurrection had a monkey's poor effect referencing pet cemetery to assist in translating to the audience that something is wrong with superman and he needs something to get him back on track a lot of people tend to confirm the corn scenes are an obvious example of an improvement on snyder's part despite the fact that superman says [ __ ] all in the new version mainly amounting to i have a second chance and i'm not going to waste it to then be summoned by the magic plot fairy what makes it worse is that he goes to collect his new suit while the world is [ __ ] ending because he has no reason to move any faster meanwhile in the weeden cut clark says he can't quite handle being in the house for too long because of the confinement of a box being too familiar he says dying and coming back was a weird experience and before he can finish lois lois finally has some character you would have been very disappointed in me i wasn't lois lane dedicated reporter i it's okay i'm back now and i'm gonna make things right he consoles her as she admits she's fallen away from her important work because he died soon after that moment they give us this you call mom of course clark recognizes the sound of the family truck in the distance or even the sound of his mother's heartbeat for all we know and thanks lois for calling her thank you now i have to send you away only to then remember that bruce is the one who pushed to have him back and lois reveals the peril the world is in world needs superman and the team needs clark we are reaffirmed in his connections to bruce lois and martha while showing lois to be a layered human being for once in this iteration not to mention clark gets to speak on his experiences and henry cavill actually gets to [ __ ] talk we then move on to the point of him having his memory back and he gets to be a superhero again because whedon was forced to do something with all of this footage so how do i help we buy him some time he can stop that box from destroying all life on earth well i knew you didn't bring me back because you like me he remembers their conflict and bruce's conviction that superman needed putting in the grave only to resurrect him he remembers their differences lois then grounds him and he didn't kill any [ __ ] civilians because now i have to send you away bruce he needs you well i guess i do want one it's terrible but it's so much better than a superman forgetting the context of his life and death only to decide to start simply executing people also he doesn't remember any of the league except a vague recollection of batman but he knows to stop wonder woman from clanking her braces together how why he didn't even see her use that move in the two minutes he knew she existed and that's on top of the fact that this movie makes it really hard to feel that these people are heroes oh let's not forget wonder woman chopping off steppenwolf's head while screaming by the way could have [ __ ] fooled me fans of martian manhunter get to enjoy him being the galaxy's greatest coward and then there's green lantern can you see this boy oh look he's gonna use his ring can you see his green laser oh another green laser a third green laser and he's dead because he can't fight with a [ __ ] that must have been wonderful for you green lantern fans out there knowing that ryan [ __ ] reynolds had the better run like you'd have to be the dullest creative mind in existence to take a hero that's power is limited by imagination alone and give him three attacks all of which are a [ __ ] laser but you know what the worst thing about that is do you know what version had the green lantern launcher hammer only to cut to his execution allowing us to wonder how he lost the fight instead of knowing he fumbled around like a narcoleptic rat the joss whedon cut drink that in i get that it's trendy to hate him right now and go ahead there's plenty of good reason but [ __ ] me joss did the better job here and that's saying a lot when it's not even his own film he's trying to fix on top of the fact that he didn't have three years worth of fans reacting to an earlier version to know what to lose from the final edit hindsight in this case was an incredible font of information for anyone creating a cut three years on and this was the best snyder could do but how about we do one more example before we close out here there is a scene where the justice league break into star labs in snyder's version the flash is incredibly suspicious while answering questions he's made to look idiotic and he's giving away that he's lying while handing his card over only to then throw in a joke on top in josh's version the card is being given in everything up to that point is cut back to snyder the screen errors out and the guard knows it's wrong he doesn't sound an alarm he simply gives a look cyborg then hacks in and the screen glitches until the card is accepted the guard mysteriously says okay and the flash says okay oh gee okay his flumpy attitude along with the recent break-ins and this being the most valuable place the dod have pushes me to think this is nonsense in joss's cut cyborg hacks it as the guard checks leaving him to be a little curious about the glitch but otherwise says it's okay the flash then says okay okay much like many examples in this film joss was given a shitty snider scene and he cut it up to improve it you'd be surprised how much he did that throughout moving on in snyder's cyborg clears out the entire population of star labs with a contamination threat only silas is the one person to believe it's false he decides to stay everyone else decides to leave and only narrowly misses these cosplaying chucklefucks as they move through the base how very cautious of you guys silas reports the situation as false only to then see them walking in none of the justice league have any concern about this man nor his desire to call them out they just assume he won't it's not like he spoke to cyborg before making this decision and lucky for them silas decides to cover for them wow lucky that nobody else stayed in lucky that he stayed in in a place that he would see them when doing the report lucky he decided he didn't need to know what they were doing instead he simply agrees with them and is it not weird that he doesn't suggest the laser treatment right now since the goal is to apply a tracker to it in case it's lost you'd think it would be disgust since he values that over them having the box so what did joss do well they got in through that gate we presume they managed to sneak around the base and cyborg hacked what was needed because joss trims the fat and reduces the contradictions while adding character and removing decisions that [ __ ] with characters but he ain't a miracle worker what little stakes there were in the resurrection scene don't even apply now because the snyder cut has flash reversing time anyway he can't really [ __ ] it up joss didn't give him that ability yet nor the repercussions that come with it because it destroys the stakes joss whedon's justice league is terrible zack snyder's is even [ __ ] worse joss didn't have as much silas or cyborg sure it also doesn't have all the problems that are brought along with their scenes the interesting thing about this video is a lot of the criticisms apply to joss whedon's justice league only it's not stuffed with inane garbage it's not filled with more than double the issues dwarfed in terms of the damage these issues deal and [ __ ] owl ads it's not two hours longer justice league has a scene where wonder woman explains her reticence toward leadership that she doesn't relish telling people what to put their lives on the line for bruce explains that his life is worth trading for superman reminding us of the sacrifice he makes being the only man among gods the flash is utilized with some degree of intelligence aquaman is given some insight and cyborg is a lighter version without the complete [ __ ] lunacy joss tried to erase many scenes that simply made this experience worse he tried to add new ones in to better connect the material he even removed all of the world building because it's catastrophic but he couldn't really do [ __ ] all with the turgid base that zach had filmed you want the true hot take i feel sorry for joss whedon that [ __ ] watching these cuts back and forth reveals a man trying to mop up another man's incessant [ __ ] with nothing but a teaspoon he made the better film for [ __ ] sure like at least joss was aware of his cringy film's story strong man as strong as alone you ever heard that no i've never heard that once in my life that's the opposite of what they're saying yeah he played into the schlock you say a word about this we'll meet every prana i know i honestly didn't hear anything after we're all gonna die zack's movie thinks it's simultaneously intelligent and mature [ __ ] the world and all i can do is laugh but what it's worse because there's more cringy jokes a jelly lip because it's color graded like a 90s pop song rather than a teenager's idea of murky nightmare piss god it's so washed out it looks like a cancer patient maybe you hate it because of the russian family but have you ever actually criticized the russian family scenes beyond saying oh it's out of place seems to me it's a welcome [ __ ] relief to have people being saved in a snyder dc movie and the coverage i've seen of this so far has been incredibly biased surface level and desperate to avoid controversy while ushering in what might be the pinnacle of the video essay youtube genre being no less bloated and bland than the movies they cover it's an epic war movie that in a way is at war with itself by nature god you're pretentious and you delude yourself by thinking you're some great writer even though you're terrible and hey no hard feelings i've only had a handful of creator references so far i think i've earned one more for the road this was my most hated scene in the entire original movie in the original these scientists get kidnapped and right when our heroes show up to save them our main villain steppenwolf starts killing them but instead of one of the four [ __ ] superheroes jumping in to help them they hang around for a second and they joke around with each other before jumping in out of the four of them nobody tries to stop the murders no actually both of them do this watch the snyder cut again or skip to this scene [ __ ] hell from the moment they realize people are in trouble they take another 60 seconds to make a move while people are almost certainly seconds from dying it's only cyborg that reacts when his father is in steppenwolf's grip which is the same as the joss cut they're both awful and the frustrating thing is that people edit out anything remotely substantive from whedon's cut while ignoring any of the insane fuck-ups in snyder's during reviews instead they pick up on one line and they add an entire history of what they believe it means to the character to compensate we've known most of these people for about two minutes the charitability is [ __ ] which is what's so disappointing so many people are praising the [ __ ] out of this movie for its script and cohesion when it couldn't be further from earning that from what i've seen of the most celebrated scenes it genuinely comes across as though people want the dullest of edgy [ __ ] to excite fan theories and hype trains till the inevitable shitty sequels come out only this is the one time we know this abomination isn't and shouldn't be getting a sequel and yet people are lapping the diarrhea right up they are engorging on further prospects thanks to hearing batman say a gamer word make a mistake i will [ __ ] kill you [Music] then i do it slow the batman joker scene made me cringe out of existence how she suffered so i could feel my cells melting into each other each inflection and poorly thought out focus and quirk splattered onto my screen causing malignant optical and auditory herpes [ __ ] this it's cognitive sewage besides who's gonna give you a reach around but why why would you do that why would you do any of that now i may not have changed your mind but the discourse on this movie demanded this video i get the feeling a lot of creators didn't even enjoy this film they just tolerated it in a wider discussion on creative freedom the wave of praise and hype preventing them from seeing this for what it is or perhaps they wanted to avoid backlash i already know this video is going to be incredibly contentious i've heard people say unironically that we at least get something in reference to additional content for characters plot or history something is unfucking acceptable for an additional two [ __ ] hours where the hellier standards not to mention the sheer number of people trying to remember the criticisms for joss's cut while fumbling all over the references failing to realize that many of the criticisms they levy at whedon's cut applies to snyder's i think you were all told over and over again that it was an entirely different movie in order to sell it when in reality it is a fatter [ __ ] justice league that's the real harsh take to come away with but it's the truth the fans were played personally i hope i never watch this nightmare again also [ __ ] supporting creative vision when you're only going to apply it to people you want to see content from and [ __ ] it twice if you're going to use that to deflect criticism from this movie i mean how many directors get to [ __ ] out a horrendously written movie destroying established beloved characters with a multi-million dollar backing and an all-star cast three times enough [ __ ] snyder bowel movements please let someone else try to make something out of this ip it deserves better than this miserable embarrassing sludge because let's be fair you [ __ ] can't control yourselves you have to share your feelings immediately because if you felt them it must be a sign of good writing it couldn't be bias even if you give this a re-watch in a year and wonder what the [ __ ] you were thinking which is kind of relevant you've had four years to tear apart justice league you've had 10 days to think on the snyder cut on top of tying your [ __ ] personalities to it because [ __ ] me zack snyder's justice league is going to age like the league of nations i told you guys the snyder cut existed every [ __ ] cut exists if you spool through the cutting room floor and add in every last [ __ ] walking sequence jesus christ there are countless additional issues being discovered as time goes on and it's only been a week i'm not here to reaffirm a perspective you have or let's be honest a perspective you want i'm here to tell you what i saw what i heard and what i [ __ ] endured for four hours it's a slog of murky miserable morbid sludge and i don't believe i deserve this level of pain what people fail to realize is that you need justice league to be canon for this series of movies to be more structurally sound for less character assassination and more cohesion with the franchise it's insane to me that there is this level of contradiction within itself and in regard to the properties it's trying to pay respect to i mean they managed to assassinate martian manhunter and they only had him on screen for 30 [ __ ] seconds what the [ __ ] apparently i care more about this universe than the [ __ ] who write it dc eu fans have the hardest [ __ ] job imagine constantly pretending that your favorite movies have even a modicum of strong writing when stacked up against a franchise that is accidentally carrying its defective brother through having even just a few movies that aren't [ __ ] balls you're a laboratory experiment everything special about you came out of a bottle snyder is not a man that best functions when being able to go at his own pace he needs restriction and someone to chop the [ __ ] out of his movies to improve them even then you end up with garbage so how about we don't bother next time good luck to the future you zombie franchise i don't know if you're gonna care about this either it's not gonna change your life [Music] hello i'm the meme repository i tag teamed with mauler over the course of many sleepless nights to help get this video out because dear lord not even the longest of men could slay this movie properly within the space of a week and zack snyder needed to be stopped no matter the cost you can check out more of my stuff in the description below or you can check out the e-fat movies for the other dc eu films which i also edited with many additional notes and givens to tear these films the new hole they have desperately earned and long since escaped [ __ ] me man people actually had hope for this car why would you believe there was any hope chris [ __ ] tario co-wrote this it was aborted from the start what the [ __ ] was the point of any of this well moller i think and don't worry i know everyone watching was just beside themselves thinking but what does jay think i think we should support the snyder cut it sets a strong precedent in the future for studious i think you meant to type studios there not in your script it sets a strong precedent in the future for studios to provide creatives with the money freedom time and access they need to create great works of art so who knows maybe next time they'll do it for someone talented

As this chapter of GDELB closes, yet another chapter is opened. Welcome to the first instalment of the initial research phase of our approach to anaemic gaming. A field of study not yet explored for the first time by ANY other astro gamers.

But first, a brief foray into the minds of citizens back in the early 2021, the culture surrounding that year and the hardships of that year and it's citizens. 

Also the Oscars we're pretty funny.",hello godelbers and welcome to the game developers essentials lessons book today on goodelp we're going to be looking at the new sensation associated with ramification framing eludite protagonal design magnification and grant there are so many ways to properly assess media analysis dissemination and i believe that if we can get this video shorter than any other gideob then maybe we can create the best one yet brevity so join me gamers as we take a brief look through an extended history of time and space please subscribe and enjoy my content if you wish to support my content please subscribe all right it's been a long while since i've returned to my roots and discussed gaming but considering recent events i believe it's time dark souls bibis bag hype dark souls 4 hit the shelves on november 23rd taking the realms by storm and i couldn't see any shitty cgi while also paying attention so as far as i'm aware it's very good but there has been many controversy regarding the game's accessibility and its take on neurographic eloquence personally i believe the answer can be found in the third installment secret boss garwin no one bad is truly bad me gwan isn't saying words he's too busy interrupting himself by taking actions though there is one interesting thing about this man he is a single dad meaning he is the only champion inspired from league of legends goon is a boss that slipping on entry was a signal of asserting dominance and you can save your game whenever you want though this wasn't enough as we discover in chapter 2 what the marvel cinematic universe [Laughter] it doesn't share everything with dark souls but there are similarities we simply cannot ignore such as the 10 rings which are pretty great you can make a big punch and then with 10 you can make a really big punch then there's the constant use of the single color spectrum and the grievous violation of the three-act structure popularized initially by sci-fi fantasy noir romance dune but paul slams down the water and the audience is like no paul what have you done if someone calls you a dumb ass 500 times you're probably a dumbass bill bag some people disagree with this quote by citing mobs but like dude no those are general non-specific things bennis baggins brother of bag let's get back to gaming [Music] black widow hit the shelves on november 23rd and it shocked viewers by once again allowing captain america the opportunity to take the limelight away from the titular character and it shocked the viewers worldwide by approaching the very adult subject in very mature ways what previously natasha roman an absolutely proudly woman she was only the hot one yes she burned the hulk but that's not character allegedly she wanted a family which is pure yike even if it was circumnavigated by her sweet sister nieve you and i both know it was magical when black widow was gliding above the hundreds of bodies of the prison it was actually directly inspired by moulin rouge both protagonists saw beneath this mass of men unfortunately they kill her in this installment and they did it off-screen which is bad though it is worth keeping in mind that if it's bad for someone to die off-screen then all books are bad because nothing happens on screen in them but then they make history they just get right in there and they chop them all away everything else like honestly a frank conversation about hysterectomies in the mcu sign me up because ultimately in soviet russia task masters u someone needs to find this kid and smack him in the mouth though this isn't the chamber of echoes and so i'd like to point out some flaws like how she isn't super powerful but she is the best at everything all that red goo clearly symbolizes freedom while the green goo uh they didn't tell us that yet nuanced what does that mean let's get grasp tactics here if you're adapting material and you're lucky you're fine like yeah some people complain about batman murdering people but those people chose the wrong side it's akin to mr hyde he both figuratively and literally makes faces but audiences hate it they hate heroic sacrifices because it means characters have to die though if we're on the topic of dc comics i think it's time to mention loki the critically acclaimed video game hit the shelves on november 23rd and the casting of the new doctor who was intrinsically tied to it doctor who and sherlock wouldn't need to cast tom hiddleton and benedict cumberbatten because sherlock is just earthly doctor who if you think about it the old dock is quite the shaming weasel what you know it really pisses on my cornflakes that marcus only spares caitlyn because of his tribalistic bigotry the dialogue was so on the nose oh no i can't pull the trigger i'm too racist though the big problem with loki is that there's not more of it i think we were all very excited with kang's performance and i would like to see his future outings more than i ever did with thanos but in comparative silvie has a more concerted center of moral goodness and this is good it was also more important as after the insanity that was end game we needed something concrete the multiverse was exactly that and it is at times well written since we're about 12 percent into the godel i would like to say we have completed the inciting incident so gaming bill boss benedict twitch streamers and youtube video intellectuals have recently gone head to head in a battle for as little work as possible to help you understand here's a guide transformative content has to be content that's like transformed billy's bap now i try to get away with well i transform the content as much as i can with notable exceptions but uh um i'm what do you call it cooking and from what i've seen people complain about people leaving stream when you wish to play videos to allow the viewing public to be spared incredible boredom and frustration this is seen as a negative despite the fact that imminent death will face any of those unwilling to refill on poultry product often times my mother is unable to provide such sustenance and this is seen as sinful why are you wearing gloves why do people wear gloves what it is an article of clothing why do you wear clothes obviously because there's no social stigma against exposing one's bare hands it's obvious that my hands are cold oh hang on i got a text i have witnessed a dingle dang oh my god paul feige appealed to the kids choice award as a side of quality for ghostbusters 2016. people like gay jacksie should stop complaining about people stealing their content and instead make some content themselves and see how it is ridiculous with all that out the way i wish to talk about writing in video games the suicide squad a game about the consequence of vengeance as a motivator and form of inspiration through themes of character hit the shelves on november 23rd now i will not give this film a tomato oh daddy this tastes like grandma and i am a person with infinite suspension of disbelief so you know what that means it's clear that the it was created for streaming surfaces because it was particularly especially specifically john cena has wearing tighty whities on promotional material i think we can all agree the film was irresponsible when it came to the portrayal of criminals who were in fact murderers as well as failing to kill more white people while showing abusive mothers to be misogynistic what i think that it's downright [ __ ] up that the child experimentation murderer was made to be a villain by the other character's point of view things are happening cliche look it was bad but so many few people believe scorsese movies are better than mcu movies now and if you are one of those people at this point then you need to expand your palette and explore a simple equation loneliness plus alienation plus fear plus despair plus self-worth divided by mockery divided by misunderstanding minus guilt minus shame minus failure minus judgment multiplied by n equals y where y equals hope and n equals folly love equals lies life equals death self equals dark side what the [ __ ] is happening this actor looks a lot like javier bardem and he cares about his daughter but why does he care about his daughter well no reason is given no reason is found out just generic dadness to circle back to time and space they are a complicated subject in that it represents the corner of the universe like no spaceships work in reality but when it comes to murder the universe considers it both a morally bad and good event there is grayness to it commonly understood grayness can you tell me for a brain dead second why the first half of spider-man no way home was a stabbed dagger of darkness into my bleeding soul of death and destruction it was hideously ugly with no sense of tangible space and reality i literally exploded in the theater this movie is extraordinary dumb hood oh wow pink man lately i've really wanted to learn about gravitational physics well punto punto a subsidiary of noom is a local whale irrigation service related to systemic anti-planetary bombardment prevention and acquisition ever since i could love i loved the atmosphere and the planet we're on and when i checked the punto web zone it said we are currently in a code-red era i had an existential crisis i cowered in fear each hour of each day i was waiting for an asteroid to kill me not to mention east anglia wisconsin having suffered more than anyone lately from asteroids and i think donating to their service will help prevent asteroids now what the first 500 orders will get jet pack thingy so you can shoot the asteroids and add to the defense fund but there is a main set of packages for just 4.99 a month you too can defend against the basic asteroids heading for earth for a limited time only the deluxe package is also available for 49.99 we will knock out one large asteroid for free with the first 100 subscribers gaining access to 10 additional asteroid removals for free it is the most ambitious rpg on the market i was very invested in this project as it saves the world but like they still had to pay me for the ad obviously thank you this video wouldn't be possible without asteroids please click the link in the description rage shadow legends and make sure your panto is the right one for you now there was a huge event for gaming this year cyberpunk 2077 but more importantly the tomorrow war was a clear allegory for the vietnam war bilimp baggage an enemy that is so unlike us they are basically an alien race no seriously someone [ __ ] said this but the more important part was the friends we made along the way though before being too critical of this storyline i would now like you to appreciate the corn source christopher pratt's mario approached this movie much like a morning breakfast as he stated in an interview and to me that was smart writing it's important for our characters to have humanness this is because the ones who want to become martyrs are mostly fine with death even when it's an accident it means they get to be what they always wanted to be things aren't solved by words instead they are solved by lyrics which are like words but they aren't they are actions there's no evidence for this of course except it logically making complete sense which brings us to the character of the gaming industry what the tuscan raiders hit the shelves on november 23rd and they received some criticism this year upon their enslavement and torture of an elderly gentleman many failed to realize however that the tuscans simply do not have the resources to be humane torture to them is a loving act of mercy they absolutely never intended to inflict sadism on others and to be honest i think it's academic to compare this female character to any other female character unless you have a point of comparison regardless his father isn't some random person in the story he's a much more specific person much like darth vader when reaching the climax of his development in the third act as he saves luke or harry osborn in spider-man 3 which brings us to the end it has come to my attention that there were several inaccurate comments made in the earlier portions of the video i'm sorry for those comments we were very young then and that's the secret of mario's jumps da da

Edited by Mauler and Fringy",season 5 episode 9 of Futurama is called The Sting in it we see the Planet Express crew being presented with a difficult mission one that they surely cannot accomplish bad news everyone you're not good enough to go on your next mission that's good enough hi says who Farnsworth explains that the previous crew died on this Mission and that it's simply far too dangerous this is good news to bender and Fry but not to Leela we are just as good as any of those other Crews you sent to their deaths but Leela we're no good I'm scared too but I'm more scared of disappointing myself I'm not scared of that at all the mission is to collect honey from a colony of space bees and at first it seems they are successful despite the difficulty they face we got lucky this time but you should be more careful I don't want anything to happen to you thanks but I can look out for myself unfortunately a captured queen bee wakes up and attacks them you're gonna have to go through me he's he's dead the episode takes a turn as fry arguably the most important character of the series dies to save Leela we see a funeral in references to the beginning of the series his past loves and strong sentiments shared by each of the characters Leela struggling to deal with her grief decides to eat space honey falls asleep and dreams about fry he says he can prove he's real by telling her where he hid a gift for her before the mission just one thing I want you to do what I want you to wake up wake up but I'm not in her next dream fry takes her dancing in a venusian garden and drinks hot chocolate with her on Hyperion here take my Jack you look a little cold thank you Leela talks about how this has to be real because she would never take such good care of herself in her own dreams so there has to be a way to convince everyone else this is real all you have to do is wake up no no don't say that this is real the story starts to get a bit more complicated because Leela wakes up with Fry's jacket the one he was buried with when she presents this to the crew she sees it's actually her jacket everything's going to be all right Leela what Leela begins to lose her mind and she lets everyone know she's been taking space honey which explains her behavior one spoonful calms you down two helps you sleep three will take you to a sleep you will never wake up from and so she takes two only to accidentally hit the royal jelly jar spilling it onto the couch which brings fry back to life you see the DNA from the couch combined with the DNA from when he fell in the jelly he's back he's safe everything is fine neat Leela lets him know that she's glad he's back he's not dead and she wasn't responsible for his death and that everything is fine you have to wake up wake up oh no oh Leela begins to crack up seeing the crew Sing Don't Worry Be Happy while gradually all blowing up as a result of bee stings until coming to terms with losing her mind she ultimately decides to open Fry's coffin to make sure he's still there only things get even more difficult for her to understand and she wakes up again so she decides her mind is falling apart but that she's sane enough to know that and she does indeed choose to eat the honey three spoonfuls enough to sleep forever to be with fry since he is alive in her dreams and she doesn't have to deal with him being gone only at the last moment fry reaches out and tells her she has to fight what am I supposed to do bite it I can't you can the Lila I know doesn't give up this easily Leela is losing her grip on reality she lost her closest friend because she endangered the crew on a mission that she only wanted to complete to prove she was better her ego and vanity caused so much damage she's contemplating a solution that can let her dream about a world where that isn't the case and Fry I'm so scared fry I don't know what to do just wake up Leela please just wake up as fry continuously asks Leela to wake up throughout the episode we eventually hear him breaking down as he says it behind the sound of Hospital beeping Lilo wakes up you're alive will you're awake the ambulance took you here right after the Beast stung you the Stinger went right through me and you got all the poison it turns out Leela's decision to prove she could handle this Mission almost killed her the guilt over the damage she assumed it caused a crew member almost brought her to suicide in reality the damage she had done was to herself and she needed to come to terms with that before realizing that any dream world where everything is perfect and you only made the correct decisions is a dead end it's a nonsense fairy tale and fighting to get back to reality is what matters to get back to those you love and who love you everything in the episode is now recontextualized as Leela's point of view on the characters instead of them being themselves on top of that you see absurd realities of the world being treated as normal like the Stinger being left in Fry's corpse or Bender immediately selling Fry's possessions or the professor chopping someone's head off to analyze it it's not that these things wouldn't happen it's that this is what Leela would expect to simply be the case in her world and as the episode continues we get more and more abstract representations of her mental state the episode sheds light on Fry's commitment to Leela giving us clues that he did indeed put his jacket on her because she was cold he did get her the gift and his speaking to her is very likely what managed to bring her back to pull her from the brink maybe if you've heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together but who knows if it really got through it got through fry it got through ultimately it told us what Leela felt about her own actions what her role is within Planet Express it showed us how she felt about fry it showed us what she loved about fry what he acts as in her life it told us the effect she believes Fry's death would have on the world and it told us that she blamed herself for everything her hubris her Pride drove the crew to suffer leading to a final decision to sleep forever only she realizes that the pieces of fries she had left that she's trying to bring him back with that she's willing to die for are the few pieces he's using to get through to her on her actual death bed to bring her back to the living his voice guides her back to the real world and he gave up every second to make sure she was okay Leela spent the episode believing she had killed fry only as it turns out he was the only person preventing her overwhelming pride and guilt from keeping her in this coma forever it's bloody brilliant in season 5 episode 21 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer the weight of the world Buffy has spent the entire season of fleeing a God she's been protecting her sister from this thing that wants nothing less than to kill her leave this Dimension and leave the Apocalypse in her wake in the prior episode at the end of her rope Buffy loses Dawn the team is crippled low on resources it's a simple matter of time before Glory will kill Dawn and Buffy will lose everything instead of her usual reaction to create a new plan to act fast to give a speech about this new evil being defeated once and for all she stops she sinks and she is Frozen as the episode closes out Buffy [Music] we discover in the weight of the world that Buffy has entered a catatonic State the pressure of every event during this season has absolutely destroyed her at least that's the obvious interpretation one would have considering all that's happened I think it's pushed her too far into some sort of Catatonia Willow the witch in the team decides to enter Buffy's mind to get her back upon entry Willow sees as we do that Buffy is in her childhood home she's reverted back safely and comfortably to a child hi Willow hello Buffy Willow opens with explaining how much Buffy is needed how much she needs to come back but Buffy is reliving memories and one that we see is that of meeting her sister for the first time we then see a visual of Buffy placing a book on a shelf strange but whatever Willow then Witnesses through Buffy's memory her discussion with the first Slayer the one who told Buffy death is your gift death is what the life of a Slayer brings death surrounds her and again we see that visual then Willow follows Buffy into Dawn's room and she kills her Buffy is convinced that death is all she is this is unsurprising after another significant event in the season death is your gift upon that notion we backslide again to Buffy as a child visiting Dawn for the first time she's looping on specific memories that of meeting Dawn learning the Slayer Legacy and killing Dawn only there's that one extra visual [Music] Willow then starts to get a bit more desperate this never happened you never killed your sister none of this is real you're stuck in some kind of loop Buffy seems to be stuck in what could even be called a simple Loop she thinks she killed door nor that her failure led to Dawn's death meaning she may as well have killed her and that's all she's good for but there's that one memory that doesn't quite fit this right here it happened I know it's something small but something Buffy explains this is the place she fears the most the cause of everything this is when Buffy quit just for a second she was putting a book back for Giles and it hit her she can't win Glory will win and Dawn will die Buffy didn't just know it she felt it she wanted it all to end I would grieve and it would be over I imagined what a relief it would be Buffy believes that even having those thoughts led to her failure to protect Dawn and that means it's over it will always be over snap out of it what all this it has a name it's called guilt Willow explains it's entirely normal to want a break to want out of this life for even a second to release the weight of the world but the fact is Dawn isn't dead and for every second buff he chooses to give up she will make Dawn's death a reality she has a choice to make and she must make it now [Music] Willow reaches her and Buffy is ready to lead this episode definitely guides you through a rather layered and complex bit of trauma with visual metaphors and dialogue being Blended out of time and space while Willow acts as the only anchor to the real world Buffy Begins by hiding in her very own childhood memories metaphorically removing herself from the weight of all responsibility at the same time enjoying the moment Dawn entered her life she's clearly consumed by what the first Slayer told her that death surrounds the Slayer it is her Legacy her gift she is being crushed by the weight of these events the realization however is Dawn's death is what took her over the edge only as Willow highlights Dawn is not dead Dawn is alive and she's waiting to be rescued just like always the one thing that would ensure her death is to give up Buffy is realizing that she killed Dawn the second she didn't want to protect her anymore even for a second she then believed she's lost not because she failed a particular battle but because she doesn't have the drive to win anymore Buffy gave up whether true or not whether reasonable or not she thought it she believed it and that destroyed her Buffy killed Dawn because she no longer believed in the fight and so Willow being the grounded forceful spirit in Buffy's life tells her exactly what she needs to hear she takes her out of this waking nightmare and together they build their strength back up to take glory on once and for all Buffy spends the episode believing she killed Dawn and that this is her hell as a result to wallow in the realization that she's nothing more than death only to understand through a trusted friend that it's self-fulfilling the loss is only so for as long as you don't change it making a difference is standing up and fighting it's bloody brilliant Ahsoka has been airing recently the first four episodes were a [ __ ] of abysmal writing with the primary disaster being a complete lack of anything close to effective characterization for the main cast I struggle to know just who the [ __ ] any of these cardboard cutouts are or why I should care and that's from the parts of the show where something happens a whopping five percent it doesn't help that the actress is playing this collection of corrugated statues on Wheels feel the need to resist emoting as though the survival of Disney's stock prices depend on it but here we are the episode where Ahsoka is lost in the world Between Worlds a convergence of events looking to intertwine all aspects of the force her history and the relationships both past and present all of this because the only character I give a [ __ ] about boopter off a cliff Ahsoka Tano will finally have to face her old Master once again she will complete her training and come to understand there is quite the journey head you look the same you look old well that happens okay so if you don't know Dave filoni writes dialogue about as well as Ryan Johnson writes whodunits it's just dumb so as much as this [ __ ] clunks harder than adamantium anal beads we're gonna try and work through to the point this episode has to make it means you still have a chance chance to live so Ahsoka is here and she's dying interesting since all three characters I've been referencing are essentially comatose in their respective stories or die we are then treated to witnessing a great battle in the Clone Wars I was able to figure this out because of the incredible visuals not at all because of the zombie piss hat dialogue Anakin tells Ahsoka that as a leader she will have to make decisions that bring about people's deaths and that to win the war you have to be a soldier is that all I have to teach my own Padawan one day so Ahsoka is sad that death is a common part of the Jedi or Soldier or Warrior experience doesn't it suck that the fate of it Padawan is violence and death perhaps it's worth throwing in the towel instead strange that she would have this perspective when this is a Delta Soca reliving child ahsoka's memory meaning she is a person who has completed many campaigns being motivated to save people's lives she's not actually young nor inexperienced because that is the point of the world Between Worlds right soldiers dying and killing enemies in favor of preventing Mass death is a pretty straightforward concept that I figure she understood and valued teaching a Padawan to engage in a life like that could be considered quite the positive thing they may prevent Mass suffering something I figure she knew I'm teaching you how to lead how to survive you do that you're going to have to fight what if I want to stop fighting then you'll die if you don't fight you die seemingly a very weak version of similar stories considering how little there is to prompt this I had no clue Ahsoka was giving up where was any of this in the previous episodes and why was this prompted by Balin talking about death and destruction those lines are repeated in the previously on your leg is here like your masters she apparently took that criticism so seriously she's now contemplating suicide in the form of simply giving up I doubt anything we've heard from Anakin so far is New to her nor would it be anything that would encourage her to live or die in this scenario but then I have no idea why she would want to die it was my fault they were following my orders I got them killed This Is War so his Jedi it's our job to lead Ahsoka is apparently having a crisis in which she thinks all she seems to do is add to a path of destruction and death likely fueled by her tutelage from Anakin being Darth Vader perhaps that is her future too so why not give up something we've had no priors for in her own show whatsoever and let's be honest Ahsoka should know every detail about Anakin's much more recent actions from Luke she did meet him and she was obviously very invested in her former Master's impact on ending the war yeah remember this anyone that was a wasted [ __ ] scene Ahsoka should know about Anakin's sacrifice his values beyond that of the Twisted machine and she knew him beforehand she's currently trying to save the Galaxy and by extension her Padawan and close friend only she lost a fight to this literal who she knows this guy about as well as the audience does still the best character though I have no clue why now of all times would have her reaching an existential cry crisis regarding her place in the world and her Legacy as a destructive force when she's pretty much been a paragon in everything we've seen of her she's more motivated now than ever to do the right thing she is on the cusp of preventing the reignition of the Empire and she's concerned about her actions leading to death her inaction will lead to way more death as well as the danger of herself and her close friends you can't just drop this arc on her out of nothing and you certainly can't do it with about four sentences but this is where it gets complicated nobody is agreeing on what the [ __ ] Anakin's lesson even is especially between those who love the episode I've read their interpretations it's the equivalent of a blender of Star Wars flavored cope don't die live is the takeaway but many are digging a hell of a lot deeper because filoni has left this incredibly confusing and vague people speculate that Ahsoka feels responsible for the deaths Anakin caused as she did not prevent his fall meaning it's time she gives up if you she had such enormous concerns about these sorts of events and decisions then why has she been such an active participant in this form of activity without hesitation for so long where has this attitude been not only are we now heavily writing for the writer to squeeze meaning into this anorexic script it has nothing to do with why she wouldn't want to live and it doesn't address what she would know about Anakin why in the [ __ ] world would this be dealt with now as opposed to when she found out about Vader why wouldn't you wait to prompt this when she goes through something very similar Leela believed she got a crew member killed Buffy believed she failed her Duty and killed her sister that's why their Journeys were prompted Ahsoka believes what that people get hurt in Wars where she gives orders but people will eventually get hurt if she doesn't give up that she's responsible for the people Anakin killed that she may become as destructive as Vader that Sabine is simply fated to become as destructive and death ridden as everyone else in this line of training and what this was prompted by falling off her Cliff why are you showing me that she feels bad for the Clones that died under her command as though that justifies her belief that she brings death everywhere she goes and thus should die herself are we not talking about the lives saved the places liberated or the goods served this was no mistake made based on her own flaws as a character does she have no understanding of the context of death as far as I can tell we're using clones because there's actually no other reference to force Ahsoka to have this Arc nobody who died due to her own vices flaws or mistakes and so this is nothing there's nothing here for Ahsoka as a character to actually have to Grapple with she would never believe she is some destructive force or that she may become one if she continues to fight when she's the only one right now who can make the difference and help I mean [ __ ] she's filoni's Little Star Wars God she is the bestest and brightest most wonderful and good character nobody is convinced that she was going to take her own life because she brings death to the world that's [ __ ] [ __ ] especially when death is threatening the world and the people she loves so why the [ __ ] of all times would she be giving up a now thrawn is on her doorstep everyone she loves needs her and she has no significant reason to think she would lose there you go that's why we're here to see Anakin Skywalker crossing over into Vader igniting a red lightsaber looking evil cause that [ __ ] is awesome that [ __ ] is Star Wars live or die incorrect seriously just have him say nothing at this point it would be better Jesus what hell cringe is dribbling onto my screen get out of this [ __ ] Universe you Vader obsessed wannabe [ __ ] wits it's the breathing the red lightsaber the [ __ ] outfit every goddamn time you cannot tell a [ __ ] story that doesn't revolve around the same five people in this piss stain of a universe and why on top of everything must I watch these icons of Star Wars deliver the [ __ ] dialogue equivalent of rotting clown semen [ __ ] me I guess they brought in Hayden Christensen not just for the member berries but because they needed an expert in delivering emaciated thudding ass cream dialogue liar I choose okay so like she chooses to live meaning that the Ahsoka was considering choosing to die because hypothes that of death and destruction and Vader because making Anakin fighter she's now choosing to live she's gonna fight to live where others failed with her master went to the dark side or something I don't know there's hope for you yet then through some [ __ ] mechanics I'm not even gonna bother talking about she's fished out of drowning and jumps into a whale and travels to thrawn this episode was simultaneously packed with worthless [ __ ] and crushed at the moments of anything meaningful trying to claw its way onto the screen the time-wasting signature of Dave filoni is Alive and Well he takes incredible resources and lets them spill across the floor with no more purpose in delivery than a drunken octopus tossing darts at a board of emotional illusion all in favor of telling a completely Hollow piece of piss story that came out of nowhere just to go nowhere for the

Tuesday Star Wars Whoever thought to merge Anakin's regular voice with Vader's cyborg voice when saying you lack conviction deserves array this was spine tingling hashtag Star Wars Ahsoka this is probably the best shot I have ever seen in Star Wars what is so [ __ ] good about it is it that he's a good man and that he's Anakin but oh no he's a bad man too in this video oh Ahsoka sees him as both Anakin the master and the Goodman but oh no she sees him as Vader the Badman Dave f i l o n i needs to be kept on by Disney for Life hashtag Ahsoka Siege of m-a-n-d-a-l-o-r-e-i did not know you

that actually serve the story and drive the plot forward folded hands I trust them to label these as fan service is to miss the point of their role in time the Mandalorian hashtag Luke Skywalker wait am I nude we sure we don't want Dave f i l o n i to give us a Clone Wars movie loudly crying hashtag Ahsoka Anakin and Ahsoka with sithai's fire fire Dave f i l o n I cook okay so it's agreed that episode 5 of Ashoka is the best thing Disney has done with Star Wars period right like this was Peak Star Wars Star Wars is [ __ ] if you skip this episode Ahsoka simply needed to chase the bad guys inside a whale which is [ __ ] [ __ ] in and of itself her existential crisis came from nothing and is resolved with ease in minutes the idea that this is one of her most important character episodes and all of the context to understand it is apparently from countless seasons of other TV shows that's absolutely embarrassing regardless Ahsoka is and will be no different from before to after this event in how Rosario Dawson portrays her because she has been portraying her as a dissatisfied brick in key emotional moments of this series already except now she's wearing white clothes moving because that's the only [ __ ] thing they know how to do this is Peak Star Wars Peak Star Wars is Dave filoni discovering CGI smoke a visual that can barely be accredited to him before John Favreau before Gareth Edwards before well uh ain't it [ __ ] depressing to know just how stale these ideas are Anakin and the world Between Worlds annihilates what we understand to be his relationship with Luke and raises more questions than the [ __ ] hyperspace Kamikaze is this Anakin is this fragments of his life through time brought together to reach out to Ahsoka is this ahsoka's vision of him is this a photocopy of him from a particular era is this a force ghost is this a combination of the lot you understand that the meaning of everything coming from his end changes dramatically depending on the answer Luke Skywalker should be incredibly relevant to this whole series but for some reason we're pretending like this isn't a time where he would be most active in the universe he would be hell-bent on stopping any Empire loyalist from resurrecting the regime and the war he's not a worthless titty-sucking hobo yet there are countless coming events that Anakin needs to tell Ahsoka about there are countless pieces of information that he could have given her Hera should be [ __ ] fired for getting two men killed while dragging a child into an active War Zone on an unsanctioned batshit crazy Mission Sabine should be stripped of her armor and lightsaber before she facilitates the victory for the Empire once again in future by being a bratty [ __ ] idiot also she should have died like 17 times by now and you know what the worst of it is the plot the show is almost entirely plot plot plot [ __ ] plot what little character there is amount to I'm a general [ __ ] off I'm confused but I like Ezra [ __ ] off and finally I crossed my arms like in the cartoon now drool for me [Music] for [ __ ] sake this video explored three episodes of television episodes where our main character is locked in an otherworldly State thinking about how her Legacy is death but she should simply give up only to realize she is wrong escaping that Loop and fighting hard to get back to the world of the living two episodes were from two of my favorite television shows of all time shows featuring characters that are essentially trapped within their own thoughts feelings memories and flaws they spend the run time discovering more about their own lives motivations values and interpersonal Dynamics than the total character development on display in all seasons of all Star Wars TV shows put together outside of the good one of course the characters are treated with great respect and they each have realizations all ranging from intense horror motivated senses of purpose and responsibility all the way over to love and relief that will go on to change everything they understand about the world and themselves prompted by incredibly dramatic events that will stick with them forever regarding insecurities and flaws they've been dealing with since the beginning they are absolute bangers of character exploration and share a very surprising amount in terms of structure and execution despite the fact that we have here a supernatural horror drama and an animated comedy and these are far from the only examples of writers who belt out absolute beasts of Storytelling with this format it's the impressive power of that craft it's why we remember them Ahsoka much like mostly anything Disney produces these days is a [ __ ] blight on storytelling it's dragging down every last aspect while using the very few easy elements it's familiar with to Blind its audience as much as possible to manipulate using Nostalgia and to dissuade anyone from noticing the hollow desolate creative bleached bones of the storytelling beneath it's pretending to be a story it's incredible how much those who love the episode disagree as to what it's about adding all kinds of content that absolutely wasn't there Beyond an Eva evil eye glance or glitchy [ __ ] Veda visual the episode plays at the idea of a woman who believes her Legacy is death with no backing Beyond her Mentor having become Darth Vader other than that there's nothing in the writing or the performances in the entire season leading up to it a conflict that lacks Foundation when she should know about Vader's lasting Legacy a conflict that lacks Focus because unlike Buffy she did not reach a moment of almost wanting a loved one to die to release her from responsibility a conflict that cannot be less relevant when the universe hangs in the balance of Ahsoka being able to stop thrawn we play at the idea of her being on the cusp of death of contemplating suicide because of her guilt and the desire to stop fighting in a world where she could cause so much destruction within a conflict that lacks Focus because unlike Leela nobody has been killed thanks to her flaws only soldiers dying in a war to defend the world from tyranny something that requires far more contemplation and understanding for an audience than Zario Dawson Crossing her arms but no it's all about actually how her lineage stretches through all of the Jedi and that her Legacy is to train the next one in Sabine that's daunting considering the death and destruction that comes from training anyone this way which is insane considering the dramatic and immense amount of good that Ahsoka has done as a result of her training that isn't even brought up but no it's about how Ahsoka wants to be close with Sabine and train her only she fears a betrayal or a turn or abandonment even though her switch to train Sabine happened in a couple of seconds with all the facial expression of a [ __ ] mollusk but no it's about how she doesn't like to take risks she'd rather destroy the star map and condemn Sabine to a life of wondering what if then take the chance at something better what she wanted to destroy it to prevent the bad guys from reaching thrawn if she wanted to destroy it in general she would have done it in episode 1 the key to understanding the cope of the fans with this one is right here this isn't explicit I know but I think it's implied the episode does have some explicit bits the summary of which would be people die when I involve myself and I could fall in the same way my master did I should stop fighting yeah but you gotta fight or you die well then I choose to live and also not be a bad man like you were and this was brought on by utterly invented horseshit interpretation 723 is that Ahsoka sees her life as that of within the shadow of Anakin Skywalker and thus Darth Vader will she make his mistakes and is it because of her lack of action that he fell Anakin wants to teach her that she can move well beyond him and live her best Life Anew baptized in Fire free of concern that she would ever make his mistakes blah blah blah it's like people ignored everything that set this up and then they hyper embellish what this actually was to compensate for the desire to love Star Wars oh I vadered he vadered oh wow to be in that content position with the wonderful franchise at all costs thank you Dave Dan polony you have my soul Dave baloney I am not worthy filoni should be thankful so many people are writing in all of the meat and weight of these scenes for him when there's little to no evidence of a Deft hand in expression packaged with dialogue that would give the Asylum a run for their money the reality is obvious Ahsoka is not Buffy she hasn't spent more than five years having everyone die around her knowing her predecessors all die young and in combat knowing that anyone she loves is doomed when spending any time anywhere near her and to have the most precious thing in her life taken away despite every last effort to prevent it prompting despair Ahsoka is not a Leela a woman who made poor decisions in favor of her own Pride that almost killed her crewmate leading to contemplating suicide in order to dull the pain Lila believed a permanent sleep would have her reach fry once again after killing him only to realize that waking up will take her right to him Buffy believed she killed Dawn due to her actions only to be brought out by knowing her in action will create that outcome Anakin simply said this dumb [ __ ] it means you still have a chance to live live or die and you'll die trying to die There's Hope for you yet this is nothing Ahsoka is a Teenage storyteller's Love of Star Wars as an IP come to vague life is she younger walking around in a clip show of everything we love to recognize this is the coolest thing I've ever witnessed in Star Wars some of the best Star Wars content periods are we gonna get Rex [Music] simple trick of the light a stencil of a shadow of a stain of Storytelling nothing more she is a Rubik's Cube with every color on every side matching the shade of Heroes so [ __ ] special lightsabers turn and twist your interpretation to your heart's content and I'm sure you'll feel you've hit on something every time you reach a conclusion I'm here to finish your training [Music] because you'd rather avoid admitting you enjoy this for the shallow and meaningless [ __ ] key jangling it clearly is #ahsoka hashtag ahsokaspolia seeing Rex live action had me balling wish we could have gotten to see temuera's face in this episode but I will take what I can get loudly crying yellow heart yeah the voice and everything it was wonderful [Music] red that's red we should all something better the journey in this episode totaled at about three minutes cutting out the immense [ __ ] filler beyond that we had about five lines in total that are relevant to what kind of Arc Ahsoka is supposed to be experiencing somehow all of that is remembered as a great character study the second felony rolls out Vader Darth [ __ ] Vader because let's be honest this cracked cacophony of surface level character exploration was entirely forced upon Ahsoka in order to throw Anakin at the audience OMG I'm not crying loudly crying heart hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Anakin Skywalker I am not okay this is everything they did it they really did a face holding back tears hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Anakin hashtag Anakin Skywalker hashtag Ahsoka spoilers this is everything loudly crying I see Hayden watch the Clone Wars very carefully and I love him for that even the body language is the same the way he looks it's unbelievable just like 2005 just like in rots Anakin's face when he's proud of Ahsoka hashtag Ahsoka hashtag the Clone Wars hashtag Anakin hashtag Anakin Skywalker mentally I'm still here he did the thing hashtag Anakin the true Darth Vader hashtag Star Wars Vader transitioning to Anakin was pure Cinema One hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Anakin hashtag Anakin Skywalker the goat hashtag Anakin Skywalker hashtag Ahsoka years ago if you told me that one day we'd see Hayden Christensen return to play Darth Vader but without his suit wielding a red lightsaber and fighting his Apprentice from the Animated Series I'd call you crazy hashtag Star Wars then and now hashtag the Clone Wars hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Anakin oml like live-action [ __ ] Clone Wars i-s-c-r-e-a-m-e-d-d-d-d also I already tweeted about it but live action Anakin in the Clone Wars outfit ahh hashtag Ahsoka Tano hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Anakin hashtag Tano Tuesday breaking latest episode of Ahsoka reminds fans that the Clone Wars was a series they watched once it was supported more so by things you recognize than anything substantive to draw from her journey and it was delivered with dialogue about as graceful and considered as a dead elephant trying to play [ __ ] Jenga tell me what's going on battle's not over yet there are more separatist droids approaching but who cares right these shitty stories don't do well critically or commercially So eventually they'll have to write something good I mean imagine a Star Wars story about the concept of oppressive systems and their construction destruction and Rippling effects that blur the line of admirable and dubious action perhaps this theoretical television series could show us what kinds of people are created and destroyed by those very systems yeah they made that it was called Andor nobody saw it and most of the people who gave it a shot thought it was boring it's gonna get another season if it's lucky to then be lost to the annals of television history where no one will reference it again and that's not to imply this was all [ __ ] from the get-go it could have worked you could have written this to take inspiration from stories that have nailed this in the past you could have tried to write a story like Leela in Futurama Ahsoka could have been challenged on his skill by Balin and his commentary on Anakin and ahsoka's Legacy to the point of losing her patience and demanding a one-on-one combat she could have denied who Yang and sabine's advice to remain a team while taking their opponents on instead ordering Sabine to take out Shin while Ahsoka shows Balin what a true warrior looks like echoing Anakin from so long ago perhaps it seems that Ahsoka is winning her fight and at the climax Sabine loses hers to Shin she gets her legs chopped off in a particularly brutal back and forth this gives Shin the opportunity to join Balin and they defeat Ahsoka together an inverted way to foreshadow the lesson while giving Balin room to confirm this is all Ahsoka is a curse on the world death is the only thing she has to give and it's time she faces it herself so he slashes her off the cliff leaving her for dead during her time in this ill-advised World Between Worlds thing Anakin could explore the more obvious difficulty she's having in terms of what he and Ahsoka actually brought to the World when they were together to then move into ahsoka's insecurity on that topic being a weakness that has now gotten someone assumably killed more than that we could move into the line of Masters and padawans inevitably leading to more potential destruction that Sabine could become the next Wayward student inflicting their malice on the world because of their masters failure Anakin could remind Ahsoka of the good they did in the Clone Wars remind her of the events as they happened show her that a hell of a lot more came from the line of Masters and padawans than Darth Vader and even he made the right choice in the end you could then take inspiration from Buffy we can reach the core that Ahsoka is exhausted she spent so much time fighting endless battles and figuring out what impact she'll have on the future that she feels immense guilt for the fact that she knew Sabine might die fighting shin and that's just for a moment seemed like a relief to relinquish the responsibility of training a Padawan of continuing this line of risking another Darth Vader and then Anakin could give her every last lesson she would need but Sabine has made mistakes but she's not lost the only way you lose her is to not get out there and fight for her fight for the world and that Ahsoka may have felt what she felt thought what she thought and made those mistakes but no matter what a person does there's always a pathway back a person is not simply their mistakes all of these lessons and introspections of course meaning a hell of a lot coming from a post-return of the Jedi Anakin however as it stands it doesn't seem clear that Ahsoka is all that much concerned about sabine's fate in this episode at all most of the episode is confused shallow and absolutely meant to bait fans into a frenzy other than that we had about 40 percent of the [ __ ] episode devoted to team Hera wandering about but who cares is we've got Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka dueling we had live action Clone Wars we had Darth Vader and we had the world Between Worlds and we had Tamira Morrison's voice uh the clone troopers oh we had the space whales we had a battle we had wrecks and we had glut Shadow and we had Darth Vader breathing we had Anakin you know it was Vader but it was Anakin but he said Snips he [ __ ] said Snips that's what he called her in the cartoon hello Snips hashtag Anakin Skywalker Anakin Skywalker referencing his son Luke Skywalker to hashtag Ahsoka meant everything to me young Ahsoka heart hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Clone Wars hashtag the Clone War ahsoka's eyes change after stealing Anakin saber in episode 5 of hashtag Ahsoka hashtag Ahsoka Tano hashtag Ahsoka spoilers I love the lotr reference where she is now cleansed and is now Ahsoka the white also love the baptism imagery to show how she's washing off her sins Ahsoka the white white heart hashtag Ahsoka am I the only one who wants a Darth Vader show hashtag Ahsoka so my are those prequels still the worst Solus cash grabs full Nostalgia bait you fat [ __ ] hashtag Ahsoka part five Shadow Warrior is currently at a 9.5 rating on IMDb making it one of the highest rated Star Wars episodes ever really should be 9.7 or higher it's unreal how epic and great this show is we one man hashtag Ahsoka I found the sting because I was loving Futurama anyway I found the weight of the world because I was loving Buffy anyway my love for past work or IPS is what allows me to experience these stories it got me to the point where I can consider what they mean to me and what they say about the people going through these Journeys they can help me recognize similar experiences in other characters and Other Stories or in people in real life it's not enough for Leela to kick people while saying it's not enough for Buffy to say I'm Buffy the Vampire Slayer and you are I need the structure the foundation for substantive elements to actually [ __ ] be there it can't just be the goddamn jangling of tired old Keys rusted from the [ __ ] tears of elated fans coming to realize this skin walking Calamity is not what they think it is but at least etiquette vitally gets to save those he loves from Death like he always wanted [ __ ] he already did that and Ahsoka wasn't even remotely close to death they're making that [ __ ] up as much as they made up the mechanics of this [ __ ] [ __ ] worlds between World [ __ ] too but there it was Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader doing his thing and everyone freaked out loved it as much as I'm sure they'll love it weeks from now when it sours like the foul piss that it is just like the Beloved appearance of Anakin Invader in Kenobi until everyone soured on that just like the Beloved appearance of CAD Bane in Boba Fett until everyone sowed on that just like the Beloved appearance of Luke Skywalker in the finale of Mandalorian season 2 until everyone soured on that just like the just just trace it guys trace it all the way back to Patient Zero chewing [Music] we're home the Beloved appearance of the very characters that gave you something meaningful Once Upon a Time being used to regenerate that experience they absolutely did not [ __ ] earn ill-suited stewards of a bygone era trying to convince you they're the same as those who gave them the franchises to burn countless pathetic iterations marred by an unyielding and prideful ignorance floundering at every turn to create something meaningful there's no reason they can't do this forever there's nothing but reward for the simplest and most surface level mockery of what once was when they can grip an entire fan base by the balls with just the sounds of breathing the colors of light and a handful of lines I think it becomes pretty obvious Star Wars Star Wars cannot grow up entire episode but also I didn't really think they knew where they were going with it what were you upset about earlier I don't know I don't remember me neither but this is amazing we were talking marriage Aid earlier on and who knows there's always that guy said yes yeah see I knew this was happen which is that game of thrawn and but it's like as soon as you give so it must be like if you have a child you give them a toy and they're like Yay what else have you got and it's like no no play with thrawn play with thrawn for a little bit last number 30 seconds red that's red

#SeaTactics #SupportTheSeaTactics #AttackOnTitan",in my opinion the Warhammer Titan is by far one of the most underutilized characters in the series the history of the Tiber family alone and the possibilities of it makes my mouth water so when my viewers voted to see more what-if videos I immediately knew what I wanted to do I wanted to make a video that showcased the Warhammer Titan in some way and to do that I took the classic what-if scenario of the initial episodes and sort of flipped it on his head what if Laura Tiber as the Warhammer Titan was the one to go to paradise to flood out the founding Titan what would that look like and how much would the story change so without further Ado what if the Warhammer Titan attacked Paradise so when initially brainstorming how the Warhammer Titan would invade Paradise we first have to tackle how Marley got the tibers on board in the first place as we know the tibers are a very powerful family that has technically full control over Marley's military knows the true history of the world and wields one of the most powerful offensive Titans in the Warhammer Titan so getting the family on board from the start is a very important thing to do and while probably not interest until way after episode 1 for starters we're going to discuss how they get them on board anyways Marley realizing the influence of the founding Titan on the world and the eldians of paradise poses a threat to their power in might of Marley as a nation in government while they have the strongest military in the world the East are still posing a threat and their new key in all of this is the development of the east's anti-titan weapons that can shred through practically any Titan's body ripping through even the armored Titan's armor with ease and while still a ways off they know that this technology is in development and thus is in a need to bring back balance and reinforce their might they need to take back the founding Titan initially they considered using their own task force and Annie a close range combat expert who wields the female Titan Reiner who is in control of the Armored Titan barklofficus the Colossal Titan and as well Marcel who has the quick and agile jaw Titan however this group remains unproven to a degree and are still young so not wanting to trust such an important mission to just youngsters Marley only has a few options believing peridus to be full of just a bunch of barbaric Sinners they choose to not send in the task force and instead opt to go for something more quick cleaner and someone with experience and knowledge of paradise they call upon the Tiber family as their history in the great Titan War their knowledge and the true history of the world in general and the fact they're home to the Warhammer Titan is just a no-brainer the Warhammer Titan's use of armor that wraps around its body its ability to create simple Weaponry from hardening like mallets swords and even crossbows is something that would come in handy if they were to come upon any wandering pure Titans or any kind of offense from the founding Titan though this is a last resort so to get the family on board Marley has to convince them of the threat at hand if the founding Titan is left in the hands of paradise they would risk losing so much potential power to control the ldans and as well possibly losing the anti-titan weapons on the battlefield this in turn would also threaten the power of the tibers so upon hearing this they actually agree to the plan of attacking Paradis to flood out the founding Titan however to be successful in this plan she will need to create a team and to do so she starts by really just enlisting Annie lanhart using her scream ability she will be able to draw in the Titans to help flood Paradise with them causing much more chaos other than that though it's just a two-person team and of course you could call this team team best girls foreign so as the events of episode 1 unfold Lara Tiber makes her way to Paradise by boat she and her team then take a horse where they begin their multiple day Journey to the outskirts of wall Maria upon the way they take note of the terrain planning their escape if the mission fails accordingly after a multiple day Journey they arrive at her location the outskirts of wall Maria spending multiple days observing the walls making sure that she can make her way in undetected she finds an opening to go to the wall there she uses her ability to burrow Underground to create a tunnel basically to allow her to get past others undetected much easier they then begin to launch their attack and he calls all the pure Titans for them the Warhammer now with a small army of pure Titans behind her charges at the main gates to wall Maria creating a giant Spike battering ram she easily smashes through the gates breaking them permanently and allowing swaths of pure Titans to roam into the walls the initial reaction from the people is of pure confusion most people are not able to see what actually happens initially but they can hear the sounds of the Warhammer Titan breaking through the battering ram I would have the scene start with her basically repeatedly ramming against the gates which would create a horrifying sound for the people in the village when she finally breaks through debris from the gates are sent flying splintering some and paling others but for the most part temporarily blinding those within the crossfire allowing the Warhammer Titan to make her way in pausing for a short second before dropping her battering ram it's important to note that Lara Tiber however due to the armor around her Titan and the fact that she now needs to be more mobile she opts to not burrow herself into the ground and instead creates a mallet destroying even more buildings creating even more chaos we know she has the ability to burrow herself into the ground but as well naturally can still be within her name as her ability was one that was learned not just a natural ability of the Titan itself it also makes future encounters with Laura Tiber much more interesting as they don't know that she can just burrow herself into the ground making all fights with her so much more tense and high stakes homes are wiped out in an instant some of them containing families and people that are ripped to shreds from the hardened Mallet simply put it is purely a horrifying sight that befolds now begins their second phase flooding wall Maria with pure Titans and you can guess what happens from here as the pure Titans basically wander around causing Havoc eating people at random and just generally being horrifying and a nuisance Aaron Armin Mikasa and honest seeing this make the way to their home and what they see is unlike anything else they see the mangled corpses of people strewn from their homes some ripped in half for only pieces of them are left but there is hope as their home is left intact and as they begin to run towards it they see their mother in shock as she is petrified at all of the horror before her but seemingly in the blink of an AI the Warhammer Titan appears with its Mallet wiping away homes the Warhammer Titan then begins to make its way over to the Jaeger family home randomly just selecting targets chooses the home of the Yeagers as it goes to swing the Mallet tearing through the house and sadly through Carla Yeager who is before her son's very eyes ripped into shreds from the force of the Swing along with the debris from the house debris are then sent flying at Aaron and the others which is when honest on a horse he had gotten from a stable that was partially destroyed spots them and grabs them both before a wave of debris hit them of course not wanting these kids to die he brings them to the evacuation fairies as this is happening Aaron is screaming in shock pain and anguish over what he had just witnessed upon arriving on the ferries Hana stays behind but sends them off Aaron still in shock over what just happened not even truly believing this is reality as at this point is shocked once again as the fairies are now packed people are begging to get on the boats and save their lives as the pure Titans are flooding in however when the gates close believing they are safe moments later the Warhammer Titan Rams through the gate using a ram it created from its hardening like before breaking it killing plenty more and more importantly allowing the rest of the pure Titans to flood in as these pure Titans flood in the Warhammer Titan starts to mercilessly kill swaths of people now sporting a blade used from her hardening this sends the fairies off quicker however seeing this the Warhammer Titan decides to take out the fairies and creates a crossbow with her hardening abilities once more taking aim and destroying one of the fairies killing many leaving some to drown and the rest to helplessly survive if they can however going to fire a second shot she realizes she is nearly completely out of energy and if she continues on anymore then she will be left vulnerable despite all of the chaos surrounding her considering her work here a success even though it did not produce the results desired or needed it was good enough and just as quickly as she appears she leaves burrowing through the ground out of paradise as the Warhammer Titan's body just suddenly stops motionless as it falls crushing more people and slowly decaying leaving behind only the hardened suit that was around her body her weapons that she used the Mallet sword and crossbow and that's it just as quickly as she appeared she is gone vanished in this scenario the immediate aftermath is rather interesting because Aaron witnessing all of this goes from disbelief to only one thing in his mind Revenge he swears to get revenge for the death of his mother the killings of his people and all of it will be against the Titans he only wants one thing and that's to eliminate from existence the Warhammer Titan and then all of the pure Titans on top of that Aaron's Newfound Rage Against the World leads him down quite a similar path to where his character usually goes becoming more nuanced of a character after he touches Astoria and Dinah Fritz which do happen in my version but you know we may cover that in a part too if you want it we kind of can't cover the entire story here today Aaron Mikasa and Armin as well spurred on by these events become Cadets in the military to train to discover the truths of the world outside the walls and of course to get revenge for the attack of their people as well honest wouldn't feel as guilty over not pursuing The Smiling Titan and leaving Carla so some of his character would be salvaged from this and would lead him even more down the road of alcoholism as witnessing Carla's death the slaughtering of his people by the Warhammer Titan and him feeling he let everyone down drives him into a very dark place then we have the mystery of the Warhammer Titan that would permeate through a lot of the series instead of Aaron seeking revenge against the armored and colossal Titans the visions of his mother being wiped out by the Warhammer is one that is more personal and more brutal as he saw his mother die in a very brutal way right before his own eyes as well the central antagonist would still be Marley but there would be more of a central antagonist in Attack on Titan for Aaron's character this would last much longer than with Reiner as Aaron seemingly moved past Reiner upon learning the truth of the world and the future still though the Warhammer would become a sort of goal for Aaron's character to exact his revenge on and one of the big motivating factors throughout is for Aaron Mikasa and Armin to find the Warhammer Titan finding any leads they can that would Point them in the right direction for the most part though I tried to make the first episode as similar an outcome as I possibly could get it to the original story without having to change too much about it originally I was going to to have the Colossal Titan and the female Titan help by Smashing through the wall but I thought it would make more use of the warhammer's abilities to immediately just Ram through it herself and do it all alone to me this whole scenario is so much more sudden and just as unexpected as the original and changes the entire way Aaron comes to want to Revenge but still comes to the same outcomes he ultimately did the idea of a giant gray Titan with a mallet smashing through houses and slicing up people with a giant sword is you can guess is a much more personal visual than that of just all-out chaos of the original as well it's just impressive seeing the Warhammer Titan being able to outman a three-man team of Annie Reiner and parklofticus because she has so many abilities she can use to be offensive and defensive at the same time I like that she can use a variety of weapons like swords mallets and crossbows which by the way is Canon because it makes this Titan seem like such a threat immediately imagine if Aaron's first ability was against the Warhammer in season 1 and not Annie I don't think that would end well for Aaron as he is inexperienced and would have to fight against the Titan with weapons that's also a lot more armored on top of that generally speaking though I wanted to with this video create what I thought to be the most realistic depiction of getting the Warhammer Titan on board to attack Paradise in episode 1 and what that ultimately would look like feel free to disagree in the comments below but for everyone else what did you think about this what if Theory and if it were you what would you do given the scenario would it be similar or different from mine

A full 4K HDR (and 1080p) upscale of the entire series, also taking all but 9 episodes and re-cutting them seamlessly into feature films for every single arc. Have a favorite arc? Order 66? The Rako Hardeen Deception Arc? Mortis? The Nightsisters? Yoda's Journey? Maul's Revenge? This project converts the entire TV show into the definitive theatrical experience, perfect for your nice 4K HDR theater setup.

I have also reordered the episodes to fit a (mostly) chronological order based on the entire series official order list. This fixes many, many continuity problems for those who get confused when they watch it in viewing order. There are some minor alterations to the official episode order to make these arcs work as films, but any changes to the official chronological order are small (Putting Maul's Season 4 and 5 arcs into a single epic 3 hour cut, moving the lone episode ""A Friend in Need"" up a bit in the timeline to fit with the Heroes on Both Sides arc. Making Cad Bane's seasons 1-3 arc into a single supercut). The rest of the alterations follow the official continuity order (2 season 1 and 2 episodes are now part of the extended Clone Wars Theatrical Film Cut due to them being part of the Battle of Christophsis, ect. ect.) and greatly enhance the show's viewing experience.

these three figures appear throughout the jedi's recorded history they're archetypes yes precisely they're sometimes referred to as the father son and daughter the loaf wolves have moved in fact they now form the portal i also find it interesting that the position of the daughter's head and the hand of the father has changed the father is clearly showing the way to the portal the wolves are the

And you know what? That's okay.

I understand that a lot of Scarlet Spider fans are rightfully upset with how he was handled in the film, but I've had a chance to sit back and take a better look at the whole situation. Sure, Ben has had a rough string of bad luck with Spider-Man Beyond and becoming Chasm, but to me this is a lot better than that. Having everyone's favorite blonde webhead be a bouncy, muscular bro in a feature film is a far cry from how Marvel has been treating him in the comics.

Steam - https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198230255036/",yeah that's right when you read the title you know why we're all here Ben Reilly also known as The Scarlet Spider is a himbo through and through in the new hit Spidey film across the spider-verse and you know what that's okay now you know me I am a massive Ben and Riley fan he's easily my favorite while growing web Slinger of all time and let's be real the man hasn't had a win in a long time from getting glidered in the back by the Green Goblin to getting danced slotted into a bad twist villain to becoming cast oh and he had this awful costume for like two issues in the Peter David Scarlet Spider Run I hate that thing anyway you know what I mean our favorite blonde Spider-Man has been through it time and again and I like many of his fans was hoping for him to have a respectful and well-written role in across the spider-verse it didn't even have to be a big role and frankly with a design that good I wouldn't even care if he didn't have a single line he could have just looked cool and hung out in a couple of scenes I would have been sold but what we got was unfortunately a weird knock at the 90s Edge that Ben was literally created to subvert back in the day I'm not kidding when Benny boy entered the Marvel Universe officially Pierre was busy doing this idiot no point in trying to hold on to ghosts they'll only slip through your fingers the past is Dead As Dead As Uncle Ben and on May no I can't I won't even think about that let Parker worry himself sick let Parker weep let him mourn on the mask and the spider I don't know if that's what I want but it's what I need [Music] yeah just generally being a total Edge Lord while Ben was pulling himself together and generally being a Kinder more soft-hearted hero you see readers were kind of getting tired of Peter Parker having a mental breakdown and crying for his mommy and daddy in front of the Green Goblin and uh well they wanted a change and the Scarlet Spider was that change even with his tortured past he was more Plucky more thoughtful and tended to think outside the box power through situations where Peter tended to Fall to Pieces his first fight was literally against Venom who he beat one on one without the use of Sonics or fire or any kind of trickery something Peter was never able to do so you could understand when fans of the character weren't too happy seeing him whining about his past and being this weird mopey edgy mess in across the spider-verse I for one was really disheartened to see that until I sat back and thought about it for a good long while after I got home and took off my Scarlet Spider hoodie that I'm thankful to say I got a couple of compliments on in the theater you see the spider-verse films tend to flenderize certain aspects of the characters they adapt they did it with Noir spider ham Penny and even Peter B himself they all had certain characteristics pushed to the Forefront and I accept that they're not perfect one-to-one adaptations but they were all flashy and funny enough in the film that it made audiences want to check out their comics I know a lot of Noir fans were created the moment that flowing black and white trenchcoat popped into the frame and let's be real one characteristic of Peter Parker that doesn't tend to see the light of day and adaptations is um well let's be honest with ourselves here he's a bit of a Hima from time to time at least and I love that the version of Spidey we got to see bring his true himbo nature to life on the big screen it was Ben Reilly I mean come on the guy was absent-minded like flexing his bicep while Miguel was talking about how being Spider-Man was a sacrifice and don't forget the yeah but I'm using my biceps I don't know after thinking long and hard about it I'm cool with it and I take his first scene leaning against the wall showing off his perfect hair while agonizing over his past as him showing off he's so fun the way he strikes his poses his gorgeous crop top hoodie that defines his perfect ABS there's no way that Ben Reilly is not meant to be the perfect himbo you know and love in spider-verse I mean come on It's gotta be on purpose and the way Andy Samberg voices him really gives off the right vibe you just have to Vibe with it and enjoy the ride plus Ben isn't the focus of the film anyway he's just a fun lovable side character that once again is cool and flashy enough that audiences will definitely want to pick up some of his comics which are not bad believe me I know that clonezaga gets a bad rap in the old comic purists but it's not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be the relationship between Peter Parker Ben Reilly Mary Jane Kane and so on it's honestly some of the best Spidey content you can find out there seeing these two go from unlikely allies to Brothers is a treat to sit down and read and I strongly suggest you go crack open the complete clone saga epic and the complete Ben Riley epic in that order for all your favorite spider bro moments but yeah if you like me and you love Ben Reilly and maybe you're a little down in the dumps over how he was betrayed across the spider-verse it's back relax crack open a jar of sweet relish and look at him a different way as the beautiful blonde Ken doll himbo he was born to be now with that being said I'm Gonna Leave You with a little Scarlet Spider comic dub that I'm pretty proud of and sign off for the night this is the synth Voice network wishing all you True Believers out there a fun time with across the spider-verse haven't been back here since that night and that very first confrontation with my better half the original Peter Parker the so-called real Spider-Man I still don't remember much between the explosion of the stadium and waking up at the foot of the Smoke Stack but I always figured that he brought me here for some reason I can't help wondering if Peter ever faced A Moment Like This if

computer disc could hold a miracle new evidence that I'm actually the one true Peter Parker or it could be another one of the Jackal sick jokes after all these years away the dreams and the doubts I still can't help but wonder what Peter would have done [Music] cause I'm not Peter Parker not that Peter Parker not anymore and Ben Reilly no longer needs validation from anything anybody but me Jackal only reminded me of that again tonight my own rootless existence each and every friend and foe along the way is long since proven that life is in the living [Music] foreign [Music] 
399,AnqMXvNmrnQ,2023-08-31T02:22:25Z,Why this scene was actually awesome,"I want to talk about this... somewhat controversial scene from Ahsoka Episode 3, and why I think it was actually really cool. All that and more on today's Star Wars Ahsoka video!",probably the biggest point of discussion among Star Wars fans in episode 3 of Ahsoka was something that wasn't really related to the main plot thrust but rather something that's been simmering in the background that being the forest sensitivity or black thereof of Sabine Wren and I think a lot of people are getting this wrong first of all huyang is a hater but it's cool I love him for it but did Ahsoka change fundamentally how the force is viewed I.E that anyone with the right amount of effort could become Force sensitive well no not really I don't think that's the lesson the show is going for here yes it's possible that with years and years of training Sabine might be able to do something as simple as grabbing a cup and maneuvering it slightly with the force but that's how things have always been early on George Lucas's view was that the force touched all living things and I mean it's not just George who says that Yoda says that as well but that it was the Jedi who dedicated themselves to mastering the craft arguably that's evolved even more where Ahsoka straight up says that a lot of Jedi potential simply comes down to skill ability which seems to be naturally ordained for a sabine-like character from Star Wars Legends a great example would be George Kardash from the thrawn duology he spent over a decade studying the force and was able to develop some rudimentary abilities despite not having any real natural Talent

#AttackonTitan #ShingekinoKyojin",foreign the opening sequence of episode 33 much like the remainder of this Arc as a whole gives us absolutely no room to breathe and drops us right into the climax of the fight right away bertolt's Titan comes crashing down on top of Weiner and Aaron its body erupting into a massive steam Cloud shaking the walls to their very core simultaneously scalding and forcing the scouts away I think this is also further evidence that the disappearing act we saw in trust is very much a plot hole as even with the all-out steam explosion he does here as well as the fact that he really has no reason to stick around after he falls down his bones are still left behind just like they should considering the bones are the only part of their body that they cannot burn away and that's not even mentioning that the trost steam explosion didn't burn Aaron who was less than a meter from his body this one caught people at least 25 meters away they were halfway up the wall I mentioned it briefly the last time but him retaining his form Atop The Wall was meant to draw attention away from Reiner so there he obviously wouldn't want to disappear but in this case using the last of his mask to decisively blow everyone as far away as possible seems like the far smarter decision which is exactly what he does but still bones are left behind so yes exactly like I said way back in trust I do think it is a very very rare but a plot hole nonetheless Titan Shenanigans aside though we hear this eerie and almost horror-like music as both Aaron and Emir captured immediately planting us not only in a place of uncertainty but also very very explicit loss [Music] this is no longer the reveal of Reiner and bertoltz this isn't a fight against them we lost Aaron someone who in every single Mission thus far was the single most important person is captured by the same people who started this all and so naturally I think the dominance emotion here isn't actually anger or rage but rather fear at this point we have lost we know that for an absolute fact and we have no idea where they're going going the person who was meant to be the Hope For Humanity well he's gone as for the title of the episode Hunters I think this one has a couple of pretty straightforward interpretations first off I think you could refer to Reiner and burrito who have very explicitly hunted down Aaron and now have made off with their prey to who knows where but secondly much like we saw throughout season 1 I think there is also a very solid case to be made that this is referring to the Scouts in many ways this is the very first time when we know we are going after Titans this is no longer some sneaky Mission laid out by Airwood where we have certain suspects like we saw with Annie for example no now we have two names we are hunting down Reiner and Bertolt those are our two enemies moving into the episode itself much like with the reveal of Reiner and bear told a few episodes prior we aren't just yet given a follow-up as to where they are rather we got to pixel sleeping atop the wall and importantly we don't yet know when this is taking place as of right now we know that Aaron has been undefeated and that is it naturally you expect some level of urgency rights but just like with the reveal of Weiner and bertoltz well the series keeps you wanting and while Pixis was always far more open-minded when it comes to the Titan threats from within I don't think it's a stretch to say that him being woken up here just as the news of what happened is broken might also be a subtle way of showing how he along with the rest of their core are now waking up to the truth of enemies walking among them with even the MPS now being deployed all over the streets it is of course a reaction to the any incidents but I think from a narrative sense they are very much waking up to the truths of the world especially with what's to follow with the Royal government Arc though Pixis then says that if they hadn't seen any trouble honest's Squad should be returning any moment now which one reminds us that honest did definitely run into trouble and two reminds us of what this entire mission was about in the first place don't forget that season 2 starts with the question of why are there Titans within the wall when there is no breach season two is just kind of hijacked by our two Titan buddies originally it was all about the monkey and ragako right though we then see Erwin arrive with Pixis and him exchanging a few words about how they have caught a rats but that they were still a step behind the simple interpretation here is that they were a step behind because Annie still transformed and they had to take her by force with her eventually just hardening and them just not getting any intel whatsoever but I think another way of looking at it is the Intel he received about the links between Annie Reiner and bertoltz keep in mind that the first person who got that intel was Erwin so in other words they were a step behind because even when they thought they got the rats turns out that there are potentially two more ones which unbeknownst to them have already transformed so again it all links back to the female Titan Mission and then keeping the rest of their squad isolated after we captured Annie much like airwin feared all along we got the rats but there are just more of them we then cut to the MPS who are all giggling amongst themselves saying that we never saw any Titans yada yada only for Levi to apologize saying that they go on Expeditions all the time saying they are more than welcome to join them much like with the Annie capture Mission I think all of these extra scenes of the MPS being entirely ignorant of what's going on are just there to remind us of where they stand in this entire conflicts in Sue thus far we have rarely seen any of them so in a meta sense I think it's just a practicality of reminding us of where they stand though in story it of course also sets up their huge turn in season 3. even now we've already gone from the MPS never leaving the inner walls to them already being on the front lines well in season 3 they'd be fighting right alongside the scouts to the point that their regiments no longer really matter and it is all about fighting for Humanity as a whole just like we saw with Pixis we are now awake and we know of the threat within the following arcs are all about forcing us to come together to figure out the truths of the world and eventually fight the greater threat that sent in those traders to begin with though we then see Phil and Sasha arrive with them catching up pixes and heroin on everything that has happens first off they just say that there is no breach whatsoever we've heard this line repeated like a dozen times from a dozen different characters so much like the rest of the season it just continues to ask that question of how there is of course some information of symmetry between us and the characters in universe as we've already seen Z control Titans but still jumping to the conclusion that he can create them at this point in time is a huge leap though in Universe we'd of course also be getting just a few more hints with Amir very soon though secondly he knows that they ran into the 104th Corps that being Aaron's Squad and then saying all of them were missing their gear and three among them transformed this is another one of those times where you have to take a step back from the story itself and realize that the author is trying to tell you something with all of this dialogue someone sat down and wrote that line choosing very specific words why would you say they were lacking their gear why is that detail important well because it is important just like we've been talking about ever since the female Titan Mission him specifying that they were all missing their gear and it's the same Squad that also had Titans within immediately tips you off that Erwin expected this much like has already been alluded to with the flashback we got a few episodes prior it's no coincidence that those suspected of having Titans were also stripped of all their gear and also note that Erwin is not the least bit shaken much of that is of course just airwin B air wind I don't think there's a single thing in this world that can shake this guy but I think much of this also just comes down to the fact that this isn't really that big of a surprise rather he immediately jumps to the question of tell me exactly what happens he was attempting to bait out the colossal and armored in season 1 already after all to a certain extent this was the goal all along well minus Aaron being there and most certainly minus Aaron being captured of course this also finally gives us a point in time where all of this is actually happening and also reminds us that it takes time for information to travel we might be Eight Episodes deep into the season but it's barely been a couple of days since Annie's capture and unfortunately we don't have a funny goofy WhatsApp group to send messages to Erwin by the time Sasha and Phil arrive the fight is long over and they've lost this whole aspect of how information travels is used a lot throughout especially with things like the anikap capturing Mission and isolating Aaron's Squad all of that is hinged on the information of symmetry between us as the viewers and the characters in Universe with everything that will transpire next and especially with Aaron's founding Titan just keep this in mind and lastly there is Jean in this entire situation coop is having a very very bad day right now keep in mind that he was used as the air and step in so unlike the rest of his Squad he has been present all throughout but that is also now resulted in him being entirely in the dark about what's actually going on with the rest of his Squad so him receiving news that not one not two but three of them are shifters probably has him doing some serious reflection also haha funny goofy episode with a lot of horses is when Jon finally appears in the season get it it's funny because he looks like a horse apparently I don't know it's funny goofy returning to wall Rose though we get a bit of a role reversal as we see migasa wake up with Armin by her side but I think this one deliberately paralleling what we usually see after each and every mission is with the explain listed goal of telling us that Aaron's story has just changed he now knows the true enemy and far more importantly in a mere few hours he would awaken the Founder's power so seeing Armin and meek is up simply looking out at the vast distance between them and their lifelong friend Aaron I think very much tells us that things will never be the same unbeknownst to them they have already lost him in more ways than one and if you remember the whole scarf conversation we had at the end of season 1 and Aaron wanting her to get rid of it well wouldn't you know it's migasa also doesn't have it on right here but okay let's take a step back and let's rewind where we actually are Mikasa is still asleep hold this thought for now and before we continue with our main Trio we jump on over to the mid cards talking about the terribly exciting subjects of crackers it's this insanely complex recipe of okay I won't even try to come up with something funny goofy here like yeah it's just crackers apparently they're very nutritious though so it's not like basic ones I think even this is one of those more subtle things that make things like nikolo's cooking in the the final season carries so so much more weight and as with every name in the series please bear with me here I might call him Niccolo I might call him Niccolo it really depends on what I'm saying in the sentence it'll be fine don't worry about it much like Sasha's obsession with food that we eventually learn actually stems from her growing up quite poor Niccolo someone who's supposed to be the enemy treating them to this incredibly nice food when all they're used to are these Bland military rations just subtly makes him far more endearing and caring but of course far more importantly in the context of the final season it brings up the question of do we have any enemies what even is an enemy if someone who's supposed to be on the other side and supposed to be this enemy is now cooking food for us well isn't that just a friend but okay I'm pulling a future Aaron here we'll leave that for the final season as of right now I think it's just a case of practicality the scouts by Design are meant to travel around a ton so naturally they need a lot of light and non-perishable food and this is exactly that returning to the episode though it's here where we get into the really fun stuff because we drift into a flashback where Aaron has gotten into trouble again very clearly paralleling the situation he is in currently now this is definitely me over analyzing but we see a blonde dude who's doing all the attacking a shorter brown hair dude is standing at support and the longer light-haired dude is sort of the passive one if you will so um could this be Reiner bear Charles and perhaps Annie respectively the blonde one is doing all the fighting just like Reiner the other two on the other hand stand by us supports I.E burrito being standoffish as usual and Annie well she is captured alternatively perhaps you could take the longer-haired one to be a mere for basically the same reasons he teases Aaron and is sort of a part of the fight but nowhere near as much as the blonde one and is not leading the charge but okay like I said that is definitely a stretch but wait there's more because we do see air in pretty decisively beat down the blonde one only for the brown hair dude to help him out almost as if Tamira are exactly what we saw with Ryder and burrito huh not only that these are also the same kids that we saw in episode 1. so I think mirroring this little Trio who constantly clashed with Aaron and his buddies in the good old days with Reiner's Trio who also clashed with Aaron and his buddies with further that question of who is the enemy obviously I'm not likening this to preaching the wall it's just kids doing kids things but I do think it is a micro scale example of how conflict still exists within the walls and this constant p is the enemy isn't as simple as just a blanket statement that the other side is the true enemy even amongst themselves we still have enemies we still have friends so what if that is true for the quote-unquote other side as well almost as if Attack on Titan was trying to tell you that making blanket statements like quote unquote the other side is first of all dehumanizing and second of all dumb there is no such thing as the other side all of them are individuals and clumping them together is just not helping anyone though speaking of this being just a funny goofy brawl we see harness just like we saw in the premiere casually playing games with his buddies and just saying that let the kids do what they want but of course as a full-on brawl breaks out P2 decides to join in I think all of this just juxtaposes the fights of the present day back then this was their entire world these petty little battles amongst themselves was all they knew they thought this was a huge problem they thought life was hard but when looked at through the lens of the present day where they are quite literally fighting for their lives the whole thing seems almost peaceful in how meaningless it was I mean sure they all got scruffed up and whatnot but everyone involved knew everyone else and none of it really mattered so at this point it's almost like we are longing for those days where we could just scuffle amongst ourselves even in the medicines I think the show goes out of its way to reframe these events as exactly like this Whimsical thing if you remember in episode 1 Armin was being bullied it was super sad and very serious well this entire brawl is nothing more than a joke sure Aaron is super serious and others around him are also kinda taking this seriously but it's a joke none of it really matters though the absolutely best part here are the last moments of this fight we see Aaron runoff leaving Mikasa and Armin just desperately calling out for him I mean here I don't think I even need to over analyze obviously that's exactly what's being paralleled in the present-day story with Armin and Mika sub just calling out to Aaron who has gotten himself into yet another pickle and big surprise in the long run that is yet again exactly what we see with Aaron running off eventually starting the rumbling and having Migos and Armin yet again just trying to catch up to him even in the very latest preview we have which is Awesome by the way Armin talks about how maybe he was Born to Race Aaron and Mika to the tree because you know he was that is what he's meant to do and then the song under the tree literally talks about mikusa just wanting to be with Aaron under said tree is just another reminder of what the story is the tragic reality of them always trying to trace Aaron but never catching up he is always just barely Out Of Reach that that's just what he and the attack Titan does it keeps moving forward no matter what and as we return to the present day all of those themes are just turned up to 11. migosa finally wakes up being told that it's been five hours already naturally she's angry but also sad and confused all at the same time just asking surely someone has gone after him otherwise is always the case with Armin he tries comforting her by rationally explaining the situation he says the others are injured the horses are on the other side basically saying please don't blame anyone no one has given up we simply could not do anything even if we wanted to it's just a spin on the dynamic we saw back in trust there it was Armin who blamed himself for losing Aaron and being helpless make us on the other hand just tried being there for him just as much as she knew how even though she herself was clearly in pain and so here Armin tries repaying that by offering her supports the only way he knows how he rationally breaks down the arguments and explains why she shouldn't feel angry I think it's just a really nice bit of realistic characterization and how not everyone is the most empathetic person knowing exactly what to say to calm someone down no neither Mika sub nor Armin got super sappy with each other both of them just offered help in the best way they know how make us up bluntly told him now's not the time to get emotional get up we'll figure this out Armin on the other hand takes the rational approach and tries explaining the situation though as their conversation continues Mikasa gets a sudden headache one that I think the show tries brushing off as oh she got a concussion don't worry about it but of course we know that her headaches are a very very core characteristic I've talked at length about her headaches before so I won't rehash that again but the fact that it happens just as Aaron slips away from her is of course just more fuel to the fire there are the many Ackerman and Mikasa theories and it's here where I think isayama just straight up says you know what I'll copy paste the script from this episode to the ending I'm sure no one will notice because man I'm not joking when I say you could copy paste this conversation to season four and it would fit flawlessly word for word just like I mentioned earlier migasa finally grabs her scarf immediately asking why is he to it always leave though Armin then says yeah Aaron always raised a head on his own leaving us behind I'm sure that's what Aaron was always dot dot dots meant to do I mean we sure we did mix up the scripts number one remember the I was born just to chase Aaron to that hill so um you know Story Goes kind of full circle from them racing to that Hill as kids to them chasing after Aaron in the present day and eventually fighting themselves kinda sort of caught up to Aaron under the tree there are the paths thereby completing the loop with big surprise not the present-day Aaron but the kid Aaron waiting for them again just barely Out Of Reach and number two quote unquote that is what Aaron was always meant to do well yes funny you mentioned that because p is in a Time Loop so funny choice of words because p is indeed meant to do this I mean they even add this unnatural pause with the wind blowing in exactly as he says this though Mikasa then says again let us flip on over to the absolute Banger that is under the tree why oh why don't you want to stay with me to me the rumbling has clearly always been Aaron's theme while under the tree is mikasus and so this back and forth of the lyrics is kind of what I view as a wordless exchange between them as we get into their final arcs but okay I'm again pulling a future Aaron here so let's leave all that for when we actually get there and yes I would not be surprised if the final opening slash ending is armin's Theme by the way that's the only one we're missing right now and he's supposed to be the narrator of the story so I think it makes sense we then see Hans pop up and with him too we see a couple of albeit tragic but beautiful scenes first off him showing up with a straight and somewhat defeated face only to fake a smile before he approaches the clearly distraught mikusa and Armin is just so so wholesome but number two I think this weird messed up family moments captures the bleakness of Attack on Titan so so perfectly the entire almost fatalistic nature of the story I think it's perfectly encompassed in this single conversation Aaron's loved ones simply sit all sharing stories about him knowing that he is currently in danger knowing that underneath that facade of stoicism and strength he needs them but they are completely and utterly helpless they cannot mount a search for him they cannot help him fight they can't really do anything and again you can copy paste this right on over to the rumbling only there Aaron is both the person they are trying to chase as well as the person they're trying to stop though Hans then says that he has seen Aaron get beat down countless times but then adding I've also never seen him stay down in the dub he even says that it's in his blood he gets right back up again it's in his blood and if you Embrace stuff it's in his bloodline and of course you do because this is over analyzing it is quite literally in his blood because again he has the attack Titan he keeps moving forward that is what he does and to throw in yet another cheeky bit of foreshadowing punish then says those good old days are something else of course if you ask Aaron he'd tell you they were an illusion the bird flying in Freedom combined with I miss those early days combined with eye water playing in the background man is this one messed up beautiful scene if I lose it all outside the wall and all that I told you you can copy paste this to the final season and it works perfectly and of course all the foreshadowing aside knowing how this Arc ends all the wholesome scenes of Han is just trying to comfort them clearly still feeling Indescribable guilts over what happened in shiganshin up just hit so so much harder I won't lie I do think him popping up here and exchanging a few words with his two surrogate children is a wee bit emotionally manipulative because you know he perishes but regardless this entire sequence Atop The Wall from mikus's Awakening all the way to them chomping down in dedication and preparing to go after their boy it is just all so beautifully written I think that longing for those simpler days has bar a few obvious examples a nearly Universal appeal so naturally combine finding that Nostalgia with the very raw emotional damage of losing Aaron combined with the fact that we now know that this is the last time they'd be talking to harness and even more so knowing the fact that even after all of this they are never truly together I mean yeah this is a rough one oh yeah and like complete side notes don't you find it kind of a funny coincidence that Amir and Aaron are both taken but there is also an emir that is a part of Aaron and when we catch up to Air and he activates the founder but we lose a mirror only to learn that Aaron's power is actually the real Emir yeah I know it's a lot of emirs and honestly that might actually be a case of why she was cooled off but you know what I mean though we then see Erwin arrive and I want to quickly address the question that I know has popped up a few times after we see them ride the horses Atop The Wall that being why don't they always do this and why are they doing this now to me the question was always one of practicality first and foremost raising the horses to the top of the wall is just downright insane 50 meters is like a 20 story building link Unfortunately they don't have lifts installed so imagine the sheer Manpower that's required to raise up a Band of Horses to the top of the wall secondly the trost gates are still plugged by a huge Rock So passage there is Impossible by defaults so our options are either to ride on the interior of the wall or raise the horses to the top obviously we know they chose the latter and to me the question is once again of practicality with the story even noting that it should have been the fastest way implying that even with the time it would take to raise the horses up to the wall the time say from not having to go through the gates then all the way across the interior yada yada still gives them a gold frame in reaching Armin and the others especially because we know that if hanji Squad got up the wall they are obviously at a point in the wall where there are pulley systems so we can also descend exactly where we need to I guess there is also an argument to be made for safety as in even now that Reiner bear Charles and Emir have transformed we still can't say for certain that things have really calmed down right we as The View viewers of course know this to be right on the money with the all monkey man still stumbling around somewhere within the walls so in that sense riding Atop The Wall at least gives them a bit of a height Advantage if something does appear out of the blue again so tldr the reason why they don't always do this is because it is needlessly complicated in 99 of situations this is just that one percent Aaron the person we've been protecting this entire time has been captured every single second is incredibly valuable at this point but returning to the story Astoria also makes it very very clear that so long as Emir is in danger she is going with them but you know Attack on Titan is depressing so we all know how that ends Connie chudan says that she has a point saying that more than anything he just wants to ask why I think all of this just lows back to that denial and utter confusion we saw from Aaron as Reiner and Bertolt revealed themselves even now we don't know why they acted as our friends for literal years we don't know why they suddenly reveal themselves now we don't know why they saved us a dozen times I mean Reiner saved Connie literally yesterday so naturally the why is the only thing he wants to know at this point he's not yet even really angry at them because he just doesn't understand it conceptually they are supposed to be our enemy but why though hanji then casually cements their absolute goat status as they literally crawl up to Erwin to explain their thoughts on the matter so the next time you say you're tired remember hanji do you still have enough energy to crawl good well then crawl that is a mega chat right there but here we're basically just given a bit of a lure dump on the following Mission with hanji saying that even if they are going to Walmart yup they will need to rest and they will eat a hiding spot from Pure Titans all of which of course comes from their research with Aaron and the many pure Titans they've had before hanji then also annotes that they are likely waiting for the night time before they continue moving which naturally means that technically speaking we can still catch up though far far more importantly within hanji's explanation they briefly mention suppose they are going Beyond while Mario again take a step back from the story and think about it from the author's perspective the Traders were Among Us do not laugh it's not funny but yes they were right alongside us right try to think about it super rationally we know that Aaron comes from parody and he can transform into a Titan but for some reason the characters don't yet focus on any sort of internal conspiracy for the simple reason of telling a cohesive narrative and not planting too many false promises for us as the viewer slash reader the funny thing is in hindsights we know for a fact that there is an entirely different internal conspiracy going on but for the time being hanji only mentions going Beyond wall Mario something that as of right now we are entirely clueless about we don't know if there is anything beyond while Mario but these lines right here explain illicitly plant the idea in your mind that our true enemy lies far far beyond the walls something that in retrospect we of course know to be 100 true and naturally this also brings up the question of Reiner and burrito got Aaron in Emir okay but they somehow need to get to Marley right what is their plan well remember that they've already seen Zeke so they do have a reason to suspect that some sort of Marley unit has been deployed AKA they can get in contact with the rest of the units and potentially have a means of fleeing completely something we of course know for an absolute fact does eventually end up happening only like not right now but you know later but it does happen and speaking of our Marley Duo before we get to them it is time for me to take you within the paths because we need to go wandering through some memories that never appear in the show itself I'm going to be honest with you I have no idea where this thing originally comes from but there is seven minutes of unair dialogue between Reiner and Bertolt before Aaron wakes up posted right here on YouTube for obvious reasons I won't play it because you'll probably get me blasted but I've linked it below if you want to listen to the entire thing though there are a number of really really interesting lines in this one with Reiner telling virtual that he has the most powerful abilities of all the Titans and he needs to stop waiting for his commands something that we've talked plenty about already with him doubting himself even as Reiner was literally transforming and this is kinda sword addressed later in season 3 when he does indeed step up for himself but there are also a number of super depressing lines as we see the boundary between the soldier and Warrior Reiner really really blur with his voice trembling as he talks about the friends that he just portrayed unlike his sudden 180s and snapping back and forth here we see him talk as the warrior Reiner and from that perspective but in the context of being a soldier so many of these lines have this super odd and almost paradoxical sense of not knowing what exactly he even means he talks about returning back home but the next thing he says is how he feels bad about betraying his friends it constantly has you asking which side is he referring to there's also a bit where they just reminisce about everything they've been through asking whether they regret any of it they also talk about Fates and how this is what they're meant to do in many ways it's that same exact fatalistic bleakness we saw with Armin and Mikasa there are many instances in here of Reiner being on the brink of Tears as they talk about the friends they betrayed both of them are trying to rationalize why they're being labeled as traitors for them those relationships run so so deep that they have almost forgotten shiganshin and Trust none of this is really required material as much of this is both said explicitly later on as well as just sort of implied but if you do have a spare like what five to seven minutes I would give it a listen as I think is just a need encapsulation of that dilemma they are both fighting right now Warrior and Soldier right and wrong Duty and friendship Marley and eldian all of these things are at least to the extent of not spoiling everything touched upon in this Con conversation though a smaller implication in all of this is that Reiner and bertoltz talk right next to Emir and Aaron as they're sleeping on the face of it I mean both of them clearly they're out cold right Aaron's literally missing his arms no shot he's waking up anytime soon but at the same time these are the dudes who were undercover for years if they were trying to be sneaky surely they wouldn't be talking to each other out in the open right so implicitly I think it's just another Showcase of how much trust there still is between them it is absolutely dumb yes they might be leaking Secrets but it is also human returning to the episode though we finally see Aaron wake up and homeboy the musical transitions we see here are just beautiful as Aaron wakes up it's this uncertain somewhat tense beats him clearly just trying to retrace his steps and figure out how did I even get here [Music] but as Weiner greets him there is this sharp transition as we cut back to the scouts who are now launching an all-out assault for them you're awake welcome back I think it's just a really cool juxtaposition of both sides here an entire Army of hunters is getting ready to charge at them at full intensity Rhino and Burrito on the other hand with their prey still in their grasp are calmly chilling in the trees I think it perfectly encompasses the overwhelming power that the duo wields even now keep in mind that they will be caught off guard but they still got out even without having better transform which by the way this is a complete side note if you remember those absolutely awesome shots from the season 2 opening with the Colossal tossing like rocks and stuff at them I distinctly remember there were people who were quite salty we never got to see anything like that but you know it is what it is but yes with that the battle lines have been drawn very very clearly so now it's just a matter of time until they finally begin their Clash much like the previous episode my voice is entirely gone I originally thought this would be a double episode video but there is just a ton of character-centric stuff in this one and now there we're dealing with the Fallout of the whole Rhino breed or betrayal maybe that's not entirely surprising but anyway next time we'll be catching up on what the weird quote-unquote monkey creature is up to and of course talking plenty about the complete collapse of Reiner's mind as Aaron just tries getting some answers so I hope to see you back as we continue over analyzing Attack on Titan and that's the video another long boy but my attack Titan tells me the next one may be the longest video in the series yet again but anyway with that I want to see a massive thank you to our current patrons and YouTube members who allow me to produce even more of these for you all and let's also give a warm welcome to the newest member of the

following along with my berserk read-along I have just reached the eclipse so yeah other than that I want to say thank you very much for watching I hope you have a great day and hopefully I'll see you in the next one bye bye

#starwars #mandalorian #disney",Palpatine excuse me they said it walks on stage at Star Wars celebration for some reason not to the emperor's theme but second best I guess he starts off in perfect character happy anniversary later on it gets a little extra rowdy asked of all the times he's portrayed Palpatine in the movies six times do you have a favorite when I get asked that question about other things I usually say the most recent one and I suppose I would say that of course my man wants to get more work I can respect the grind pops but then he realizes when you've played the most iconic villain in cinema history for four decades you don't get a shill for Disney so he States his real opinion proudly although when the fans ask me well I usually say Revenge of the Sith I feel like we prequel fans have been living in the shadows for so long but over the years this movie in particular has slowly risen to God's status it's great to hear this opinion of George Lucas's last Star Wars movie from the most powerful being in the galaxy and even if you don't like it can you imagine a world without do it I am this idiot it's treason Ben did you ever hear unlimited power yeah I do have neighbors

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",this new Theory that's popped up about the Mandalorian and Ahsoka is crazy but also somewhat believable you might remember in episode 1 of season 3 of the Mandalorian as Mando and grou are traveling at light speed grou sees multiple pgle traveling at light speed out the window and now people are making the connection that what grou is seeing here is actually the pgle taking Ahsoka and huyang to the Galaxy where Ezra and thrawn lie it would make sense considering all of these events take place around the same time in the Star Wars timeline but it also could just be a random pack of pgle and Dave filon slowly teasing and introducing these into live action after they appeared in Star Wars Rebels

That & more on today's Star Wars video.

#StarWars #Ahsoka #Disney",this entire scene from Ahsoka just made the new Republic look utterly incompetent so this Senator Senator Ceno is someone we've recognized before he's the senator for hosnian prime the planet that was destroyed by the first order in episode 7 the force awakens so his attempts to shut down Hera's search for the eye of Sion with Ahsoka is somewhat ironic considering it's the start of him signing a death wish to his home planet the Mandalorian season 3 really dived into the incomp of the new Republic's ignorance of the Empire's return through low-level officers so to see that same level of disregard follow all the way up to its highest Senators just shows how terrible the entire faction looks Senator Ceno is obviously a clean Legends comparison to Bor failer who was a political activist in the FR Trilogy that undermined any suggestions or information presented by Han Solo or Leia to mon MMA he was also the father to the main character in The now cancelled Star Wars resistance that being said it's not just the Senators that looked bad Hera herself put up an extremely poor argument herself she failed to First mention the massive hyperdrive that was stolen and the sift that were involved she did see as sooka fighting one so it wasn't because she simply didn't know and instead her desires of finding Ezra and fr got in the way but what do you think about the new Republic after this let me know in the comments down below or for more Star Wars shorts check out this one appearing on the end screen now

Zuniroa",Oh chef you've really done it now you rabid cur you can't call this movie a cinematic disaster have you even seen a bad movie before this is hyperbole of the highest order this movie is great because Rotten Tomatoes and the Academy said so and you gave it a 6 out of 10 over a year ago so you can never take that back that's your official opinion forever your video is awful based on the title alone and I'm letting you know that before I even watch it Anza scribbled ok now that that's out of the way funding for Schaffer Atlas is provided by Squarespace the sponsor of today's video from websites and online stores to marketing tools and analytics Squarespace is the all-in-one platform to build a beautiful online presence and run your business more info at the end of the video Ralph breaks the Internet is a movie people can like if they enjoy it I can see what people like about it people can feel any way they want to about it opinions are valid with that said I think this is an absolute train wreck embarrassment of a film but before we get into that let's talk about Disney not Disney the animation studio who made those classic films you grew up loving Disney the giant multimedia conglomerate with a stranglehold on the entertainment industry given this companies reach influence and sheer volume of beloved IPs I think it's safe to make the following statement Disney doesn't need to try anymore not saying that they've stopped trying they've released some incredible works of art throughout the 2010s with a ton of effort put into them but all I'm saying is they don't need to put effort in any more in order to succeed the Walt Disney Company is too big to fail they can release uninspired remake after uninspired remake mediocre sequel after mediocre sequel and it doesn't matter people will eat it up because their emotional connection to the Walt Disney brand is too strong remember in my mega minds video when I said illuminations stop trying after the first Despicable Me because they realized they would make money either way well that's the threshold Disney finds themselves on now but to an even larger degree unless audiences get real sick of unoriginal 'ti real soon there is no longer a need to experiment or come up with inventive brilliant ideas in order to succeed as a company and this past decade has been the culmination of that fact Star Wars is loaded with nostalgia baten its attempts to be original have mostly backfired Pixar has been churning out sequel after sequel that more often than not lack the imagination and ingenuity that made the originals such a success and of course the live-action remakes that suck all the personality out of the original film and replaced them with pandering hollow pseudo woke miss teaching another girl to reroute isn't one enough you know Amy anytime someone calls attention to the breaking of gender roles it ultimately undermines the concept of gender equality by implying that this is an exception and not the status quo what does he mean it's not all bad news though the MCU has been pretty good overall every once in a while Pixar remembers how to make something really exceptional and honestly the most consistent voice throughout this decade of unoriginal 'ti and fanservice and pandering has been who else Walt Disney Animation Studios after an abysmal decade during the 2000s they've kind of taken Pixar's crown as the premier animation studio of the 2010s Pixar has made more money but Disney Animation has left more of an impact I feel their movies throughout the 2010 have mostly all had heart creativity wit energy and above all effort put in even the movies I don't like as much like the frozen films and big hero 6 aren't lazy in the slightest they're well put together and have a ton of artistic merit yes not some artistic merit and on the opposite end movies like Moana and tangled have become some of my all-time favorites these movies are not perfect but they're all refreshingly original and special in their own ways I always thought of this decade as a new Disney Renaissance of sorts but it didn't last because fresh off the heels of one of their greatest movies ever Moana Disney released one of the shittiest movies in their entire catalog and that's kinda saying a lot Ralph Briggs the Internet is emblematic of every problem modern Disney has it's uninspired its pandering it's a sequel to a movie that didn't warrant a continuation it even has a dash of mishandled pseudo woken Asst oh my gosh by golly you did it Disney yeah made the perfect storm of awfulness granted there are at least three Pixar movies this that are worse but Ralph breaks the internet more than any of these movies screams we don't have to try anymore we have our brands we have those characters you liked in the first movie we have an actual good message buried underneath the abysmal ham-fisted execution we'll take that Oscar now thank you very much we earned it for sure oh hey this is gonna be a tough one to get through but I guess I should start by being nice to the movie since it's not the worst thing ever hell it's only the fourth worst animated movie released under the Disney umbrella this decade oh wait sorry the fifth worst animated movie so let's get into the stuff I actually really like don't worry there's not much I [Music] think the most obvious thing that is not terrible about this movie will be the Disney Princess stuff their first scene doesn't feel like awful product placement like the stuff right before it it feels like a genuinely funny kind of important plot development since Penelope subverted the typical princess role at the end of the first movie seeing them take that meta commentary one step further in the sequel is actually a smart idea she teaches them the power of comfy clothing with legit clever references on them and in turn they teach her the power of following your dream heart song and whatnot it's really funny to see an unconventional princess like Penelope try and come up with an I want song of her own and miserably fail at first but yeah I love the princess stuff in this I liked how well the 2d designs translate into 3d I like that Threepio is their Butler cuz that just kind of fits right in perfectly I liked Ariel's passionate ballad about shirts I liked that Elsa isn't given more screen time than the others I like how this movie hates Merida as much as I do and that payoff at the end with all the princesses using their abilities to save Ralph is so damn good it's super creative hearing instrumental versions of each princess's theme is an excellent touch and it was neat to see a semi obscure character like Prince Naveen in frog form that's averted my expectations speaking of which vanellope song honestly gives me so much joy it works really well as a subversion of the classic Disney I want power ballad formula and it's a pretty good song once you separate it from how terribly written her motivations are reminds me of another song place called slaughter races filled with so much imagination and whimsy to the point where I genuinely wonder if the people who worked on it are the same people who made the rest of this pile of garbage okay sorry positives I'm sure there's more positives the Ralph monster is really well animated and absolutely abominable great work animation team the two post-credit scenes are legendary I can't believe Disney actually animated a Rick role like it's an older meme but it checks out Rick Rowling is legendary in the vast history of the Internet and it's not really an example of Disney's executives being behind the times it's a legit good tribute Ralph as Bob Ross was inspired and this is what I was referring to in my first review the one viral video Ralph made that was good it was this one how did you guys not am I just old and you young'uns had no idea who Ralph was supposed to be here like please explain III guess family is an okay character I don't know the part where he tries to catch Ralph's was the only time I laughed outside of the princess stuff in the song it was cute when Ralph and vanellope didn't understand how auctions work I liked how nose more's eyes are done with 2d animation I don't know I'm really trying here guys oh wait this line this line is great I like when Ralph commits homicide on this lady's internet connection and yeah that's about it this movie isn't quite the same slog as brave or the good dinosaur but in a lot of ways it's more insulting than either of those movies since it takes likable pre-established characters and really mangles both of them in such a disappointing fashion so while this film has good elements and while I'd sooner sit through it and Pixar's unholy trilogy I hate it much more than those films simply on account of what it represents this film much like the title implies is broken from its premise to its characters to its messages and hey let's talk about that middle thing shall we so I like the first wreckit-ralph movie quite a bit maybe not as much as I did when I was younger and certainly not as much as the animated musicals but I still think it's a really strong film and before any you smart alecks trying to accuse me of having a musical bias I'll have you know that lilo and stitch is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my favorite Disney movies and that's not even a musical so they're gaudy anyway yeah wreck-it Ralph is really good like I said thanks Satan I think it has an incredibly captivating setting and a really strong premise it has a lot of great video game references from the in-your-face to the subtle ones King candy is a legit fantastic villain Ralph and vanellope 's bond is really strong and they're inevitable big fight scene is actually very well implemented into the story and legitimately pretty heartbreaking and they didn't have to destroy the characters personalities in order to make it happen and yeah I don't know man that climax an ending both really give me the feels what can I say it's a nice charming story with a happy ending or so we thought turns out vanellope wants more out of life cuz after six years of living out her dream of being a sugar rush racer it's gotten kind of old and she wants something new and exciting but Ralph just wants everything to stay the same perfectly content with the life he has now that's actually not a bad setup for a conflict unfortunately these two are who don't realize that their actions have consequences the nella peas job is to be a racer Ralph's job is to wreck the building but in the middle of the day when the arcade is open Ralph's figures it's a great time to build vanellope a new track which she drives towards against the wishes of her player this really couldn't have waited until nighttime can't vanellope just go do her job in the daytime and then drive on Ralph's cool new course at night this sounds like a minor point but it's not since this is what causes the wheel to break the game to get unplugged and the thousands of candy people to become homeless all because these two acted alarmingly selfishly and didn't consider the consequences of their actions I kind of thought after the first movie when Ralph's game ran the risk of getting unplugged once he went turbo that he would have learned a lesson about not doing this sort of and don't worry we'll get back to turbo later but yeah Ralph the movie maker abandons his game for the day and in manila B's game as it's being played cuz he just can't make it through the day without his best buddy vanellope feeling down this can't wait till later oh no no no why because Ralph is insecure he's paranoid about the idea that he and vanellope are arguing over something and he needs to resolve this non argument right now and this is honestly the biggest problem with the film it treats Ralph like a blithering man baby when that really wasn't who he was at all in the first film he was more of an everyman a down-on-his-luck guy who was tired of nobody appreciating him his relationship to vanellope gave off more of a father-daughter or lame uncle vibe where there's definitely a strong connection there but it's more of a mentorship sort of thing I know video game characters don't age but Ralph is programs is this older dude and vanellope his program is like a ten-year-old girl it would be really weird if Ralph was this ultra clingy best friend who acts defensive and angry whenever this ten-year-old girl wants to hang out with someone else oh wait Ralph and vanellope 'he's relationship in this movie is just so weird as an adult you kind of bring yourself down a few levels to interact with kids which is what i assumed was happening in the first movie but I guess Ralph really just has the mental capacity of a five-year-old while vanellope is discovering her passions like someone in their early 20s would it's a weird juxtaposition if Ralph acted like more of an overprotective father and less of a creepy needy obsessive best friends that would have worked a lot better but this is preposterous anyway back to Ralph being an he never apologizes for getting sugar rush unplugged rendering thousands of people homeless and he acts like this is some amazing thing for vanellope now they can just hang out all the time and do nothing which is exactly what she wants except not if Ralph had just employed basic listening skills he could be trying to console her for losing her home but instead his head is so far up his own ass that he expresses how excited he is that vanellope can now live out his ideal life of doing nothing all day now isn't the whole point of the movie Ralph's learning that this way of thinking is wrong you may ask yeah but I feel like Ralph and the first movie wasn't this emotionally dim or selfish I don't think this is a lesson he needed to learn or if he did need to he shouldn't have acted this insecure about it but every turn he expresses how much he doesn't trust vanilla peas cool new friend shank or how sad he's gonna be to spend a couple hours apart from his best friends who he hasn't been separated from in six years except every single day when they go to work in their own separate games but god forbid she carries a pop-up ad around by herself for two hours all of it just lacks subtlety and I think the giant Ralph monster is a tremendous example of how unsubtle and creepy the message is when you apply it to these characters sorry that I don't like the image of a grown man slobbering over his friendship with a little girl wish I could tell you that I don't find that weird cuz I do i buy the connections between characters and Toy Story because they do it with toys that physically look to be the same age but this is uncomfortable and super on the nose like there's this really awkward line where Ralph basically just states the message of the movie without allowing kids to pick it up themselves I'm up here I can see how I do come across as needy and clingy and self-destructive like knows more soon I think the fact that the movie ends with Ralph and vanellope apart is enough to let kids get the message guys subtlety is a blessing when I was a kid and I watched ratatouille I didn't need these chefs to say wow I don't like the idea of working for an idiot controlled by a rat that's weird I quit I understood what their motivations were without them saying anything kids are smarter than you think as opposed to Ralph who is dumber than I thought because when he sees but now I'll be wanting to stay in slaughter race he's so emotionally unintelligent that he just assumes that she's brainwashed yeah that makes sense after all her desire to race in a more exciting environment just sprang up out of the blue she never mentioned this before like seriously dude how dense are you you've known her for six years and you don't understand that this is what she's always wanted so Ralph in a final act of character assassination decides to unleash a deadly virus in the slaughter race to make it so boring that vanellope will want to leave now given Ralph's experience with viruses you'd think that this would not be something he would want to be doing to this game his best friend is and what the hell do you know of course Ralph would do that just trust us this movie won an Oscar before the Oscars even happened phew Arthur will find some defect in the code and spread it all over the game till everything becomes quote-unquote boring oh really you're telling me he's that much of a brain-dead that he goes through with this plan after hearing that are you stupid because the only way anyone gets hurt is if you are stupid so yeah something goes wrong if an L bees gonna die and I love how there's 60 seconds to save her but Ralph wastes time explaining to the audience I means family that she'll die if he doesn't get her out like you can't else family that after you go save her you don't exactly have time to waste and then 10 seconds later shank literally says the exact same thing so there literally with no reason to have Ralph say this to the audience just one of the many insecurities present in the script but when you got too many insecurities they just build and build until your movie becomes this giant horrifying stitched together abomination that lays waste to everything in its path and that's no good also many have mentioned this but I love how the movie just forgets about the virus it's still loose on the internet right they only got rid of the Ralph's clones but the screen right I mean Ralph and vanellope just kind of forgot about this little bugger whoops oh well at least with how bad Ralph is there's no way vanellope can possibly be worse right no right right actually like yeah she's not as bad but she's still not good in vanilla peas case a lot of people seem to take issue with the fact that her story arc entirely contradicts the previous film she's going turbo jumping from game to game with no thought of the consequences the first film constantly tells his characters that they can't go turbo and that game jumping is the worst thing you can possibly do but Venipede does it in this movie what in tarnation that's bad writing and to that I say yes yes it is but not exactly for the reasons most people think did you know that people change over time they get different goals they have different dreams they think they know what they want but what they want to get sold to them and they want to find their passion somewhere else there's nothing wrong with the concept of vanellope wanting to find a different game to call home but the problem here is the rules the first movie drills the idea into your head that going turbo is bad but not necessarily Ralph went turbo and it led to a string of events that save vanellope from a life of isolation and depression all the while destroying the original turbo once and for all it was bad for Ralph's games since it appeared to be broken without him there but that's cuz he's a crucial character for the game to work vanellope says herself that she's one of sixteen racers though it's weird that she says no one would miss her when she clearly makes the game more popular still sugar rush functioned for years without her on the roster it could feasibly function without her whenever I go to the arcade with my friends I'd probably still play Mario Kart even if waluigi suddenly vanished from the roster one day it would sting and be really disappointing and it might cry about it that night before booting up Smash Bros to cheer myself up before being hit with a double e crushing revelation but hey I'd still play the games if vanellope wants to follow her passions good for her but considering the fact that she's basically doing what the villian did in the last movie and they don't even mention him once that's kind of jarring like Ralph could tell her there's no way she should go turbo under any circumstances and vanellope the person most hurt by turbos actions could try and convince him that there's some good to be had from game jumping an old set in stone perspective gets challenged by the new generation but that would require these people to have rewatched the first movie which they clearly didn't do so turbo goes completely unmentioned oh but frozen to can mention Hans just fine it's so weird that a sequel so thematically tied to the last movies villain pretends he doesn't exist while Hans gets 15 references and frozen to despite being completely irrelevant to its story and themes what's up with that what's up with that anyway vanellope though well I don't think she's as poorly written as Ralph I do think the script portrays er is just a bit too selfish like she could take time to consider the implications of leaving her game for good and all the other racers who apparently hate her again I thought everyone liked her at the end of the first movie did the racers also forget to rewatch the first movie vanellope doesn't really consider the idea that there's a chance the game won't be popular enough without her around and that the game could get unplugged leaving all the sugar rushers homeless once again like I said I don't think that would be the case but it's a possibility vanilla P should really consider but she doesn't she already went against the will of her player and broke her game also not really caring about the con quences why should she start caring now and while I think her big emotional blow up with Ralph is completely justified after what he did I still think she got off too easy regards to the more selfish aspects of her story arc she's never called out and she never comes to the realization that her actions might have hurt Ralph's feelings or her own gain between the two of them Ralph is clearly more wrong but the movie insists that vanellope isn't wrong at all and that's just not true in the end while I like vanellope leaving to pursue her dreams and the message the movie is going for it kind of ignores the fact that friendship is a two-way street both Ralph and vanellope had room to grow as friends but the movie only seemed interested in pointing out Ralph's negative tendencies as a friend which feels incredibly disingenuous okay so the movies not great it feels but that's okay cuz the comedy is really good right no no it is not is actually not I was telling a fib this movie opens up with a burp off and a conversation about Zangief waxing no I'll keep this part short and sweet the movie is not funny it's shockingly nice I had a couple chuckles here and there and even a goofball or two but for the most part this film just swings and misses over and over again internet comedy does not mix well with middle-aged dudes making a movie for kids there's no humor to be found in the Internet this movie portrays it's just showing us how the Netscape works and haha Ralph's things Google is where you get goggles that's a riot you slay me Disney you slay me if the movie wanted to satirize internet video trends it failed because all they really did was acknowledge that these trends exist shoving Ralph's into various viral video trends is quite frankly embarrassing and unfunny aside from Bob Ross I like that one but for the most part it's just haha Ralph is a screaming goat and now he's flossing also I hate to get up on my soapbox but I don't like how this movie portrays making dozens of viral videos in a day as something completely positive with no real repercussions outside of mean comments check it out kids Ralph's got rich by making viral videos you can - that's a bad message not only is it unrealistic but it's unhealthy burnout is such a huge concern for content creators and the fact that this movie pretends like it doesn't exist really irritates me just make Ralph tired make him wanna quit after making all these videos have him doubt his resolve to keep going but he has to it's for his best friend but now instead the movie decides that the comments section is the negative aspect it wants to focus on which is hysterical see this is still relevant to the comedy section of the video because these comments are a joke Ralph's video stink Ralph's is the worst I hate him like what kind of life through these people lead where they get off on trying to hurt of video game characters feelings what are they smash fans I can't believe the movie tries to play this as a serious sad moment this is like the emotional scene in Cars 2 where mater realizes everyone thinks he's an idiot whoa your yankin at my heartstrings they are guys slow down anyway yeah there's really not much critique of the Internet to be found here and Ralph and vanellope really aren't that funny but hey they're just two of the four main characters from the original film what about Felix and Calhoun remember them they were pretty funny in the first movie and they got married what wacky adventures are in store for them none going into this movie I didn't see them at all in the marketing and I really wondered what role they would have if any then they set up this great sunflower they adopt all the sugar rush racers I was really looking forward to that as a counterbalance to all the internet stuff why do I even bother this really funny sounding subplot happens entirely off screen like god forbid we get rid of some of the corporate pandering scenes to spend time with two of the main characters in the last movie doing something new honestly Felix was probably my favorite character from the first movie besides King candy so this just sucks bro I'm straight-up not having a good time I guess Felix was too busy covering for Ralph like you said he would hey wait a minute how is he doing that the arcade is open Ralph is not in his post last time this happened everything went wrong does the movie care to follow its own rules or are we just cool with hinging this entire premise on a throwaway line also Ralph and Felix ayyy boy way too much which like I think that term became widely used after this movie came out but still actually boy remember when the creative team knew what they were doing I remember [Music] it's abundantly clear that the creative team did their homework on gaming culture with the first movie now while it wraps up its story very nicely it does kind of leave you with a lasting impact and seeing Ralph and his buddies explore new gaming worlds we only really saw this one arcade but what about console games visual novels life simulators RPGs fantasy action games what if Ralph went into Minecraft and vanellope started building a really terrible house which was just like the worst thing ever and the snooty gated community made fun of it so Ralph decided to wreck their homes and then he gets chased by the Minecraft police and I'm assuming this is what happens in the game I don't play minecraft but my point is the possibilities are so endless when expanding the world of wreck-it Ralph there's so many new frontiers to take video game characters to the point where even though I was satisfied with how the first movie story ended I was actually excited by the prospect of a sequel here's some stuff I found from Wikipedia about the early ideas director rich Moore had for a second installment pause and read it if you want and yes professor I checked all the links they cited and all of the information is accurate stop shaming me for using Wikipedia it's a perfectly reputable source of information and the academic community should legalize it I hear some academic tournaments actually allow Wikipedia as a counterpick source and I think that's some great progress see look at that perry the platypus I know my gaming tournament terminology except that I don't I didn't know a counterpick meant until I looked it up on Wikipedia for this video this is what I'm telling you Wikipedia has so much knowledge to give use its knowledge I beg you okay that might have been my worst tangent ever like I don't even see how that was related at all to when I was talking about I mean I guess it was tangentially related like I needed to get that information from Wikipedia in order to inform you guys about the movie but that didn't really further my quest to explain why this movie is complete boudu oh you know what would really prove my point let's go to letterbox and see what the review say blender box is always reputable except when it's not and this movie has a what 3.3 are I didn't want to do this again but looks like I have to film another song parody in order to get this letter box score down to the 1.5 to 1.9 range it desperately deserves I think I'm gonna start a new account for that though no need to use this one I mean I'm a moderately well known guy people remember if I start from scratch on a new account my song is sure to go viral and make me hundreds of dollars in the span of one hour in less than 24 hours I'll have enough money to buy letterbox to lead all the reviews that disagree with my point of view maybe pay off some people and make sure they keep their scores low and voile ah everyone will agree with me and I'll finally be happy and hey some people and letterboxed already get it ihe calls the movie astonishingly bad I couldn't have said it better myself Stevi synopsis of the film is as follows Ralph makes an ASMR video and get cyber bullied yep no you nailed it that's that's absolutely right hmm a positive one alright I'll give it a shot okay that's fair but what does Paul O'Connor have to say this movie is really really bad I find it hypocritical that people bashed the emoji movie for being an ad but don't bash this movie at all the plot is not good the story is very weak yadda yadda yadda other words Ralph breaks the internet is barely a step up from the emoji movie man that's the most accurate review I've ever seen in my thoughts and feelings on this feature film I truly don't understand why the world of this movie is given a pass when it's just a blatant assortment of never any product placement I don't mind the characters having to use the internet to travel between online games which should have been the focus of the movie but there's a lot of time spent in this clean sterile visually unappealing Internet populated with endless real-life brands and it just comes across as gross the first movie was mostly spent in sugar rush which is such a visually appealing deliciously animated world but this movie primarily takes place in this boring blueish wastelands wasteland shut up John Ratzenberger go back to Star Wars fun fact John Ratzenberger actually appeared in The Empire Strikes Back as the guy who tells Leia the shield doors must be closed it's interesting because many creatives who frequently work for Disney like Favreau and Tyco ITT make little cameos and Disney Star Wars projects but John Ratzenberger who's had a voice role in every Pixar movie got his Star Wars cameo in 1980 way before Disney purchased the brand's and before Pixar even existed that's kind of bonkers and I'd like to thank Wikipedia for giving me this information I will be reminding you of Wikipedia many times throughout this review is gonna pop up again don't you worry well let's see what I did in the segment so far I think it was about 10% substance and 90% around various websites for tangentially related reasons and I for one am proud of that as a matter of fact I fully expect this video to win the Academy Award for Best video essay which will be implemented at my request once my ambitious plans to purchase every website known to man go through I'll be a shoe-in the quality of my analysis it doesn't matter I have more than 10 subscribers my channels too big to fail why do I need to try anymore why even bother let's bring it all back to the crown jewel of this movie the oh my Disney sequence people like to leverage a certain complaint against movies with product placement in them it's just a commercial this Playmobil movie is just a Playmobil commercial immanuel movie using a moon joke commercial Al Pacino what are you doing no you're the chosen one sorry Albert I didn't want to do this but we gotta put you down buddy when I talk about a sponsor I do so with the knowledge that a I've made it clear that this is sponsored content and be my audience consists of teens and adults who understand the concept of sponsored content children don't realize that the movie they're watching subliminally wants them to go - oh my Disney calm and take thee what Disney Princess are you quiz themselves which before you ask I got jasmine they don't realize that they're being primed to listen to the pop cover of let it go over and over they don't realize that the movie wants them to ask their parents to see Star Wars or guardians of the galaxy or Toy Story right after what I'm sorry what the hell how do you pick up Buzz Lightyear's design that badly just borrow the model from Pixar it's not hard I understand that this is just a three-minute scene and it's pretty unimportant in the grand scheme of the movie but hey it dominated the marketing now didn't it it's clearly the take away Disney wanted to leave you with and it's genuinely so jarring that it takes me out of the film entirely the magic of watching a new Disney movie is sucked out completely because the film bombard you with brands instead of artistry Disney has really gotten on this huge and nostalgic kick as of late cuz the more it reminds you of its previous works a lot more people will die or get a Disney Plus subscription that works for them too the live-action remakes and Star Wars movies are the most obvious examples of nostalgia bate but then you got endgame we kind of ignore this aspect of the movie since we all liked it and it fit the story really well but damn don't you want to re-watch that first Avengers movie again don't you want to put on that fun as hell guardians of the galaxy movie don't you want to give Thor the dark world another chance oh please oh god give it another chance and there's frozen - in my review I complained about the movies bizarre need to reference the first film over and over but wow that was intentional wasn't it all this talk of hinds and these snow sculptures depicting the events of the first movie if you're a little kid how can you not want your parents to put on the first movie as soon as you get home and Toy Story 4 didn't actually fall into this trap to be honest I'm very impressed but Ralph breaks my theme patience did this whole scene is a trap to quote the late fleet admiral guile Akbar children can't repel advertisements of that magnitude that might have been a paraphrase I'm not sure if you wanted to satirize the Disney brand than fine but that's not at all what this is we get that from the princess scene a little bit and that's all fine and good but what does this ready player one jumble of nostalgia really accomplish in the grand scheme of the film nothing there's nothing funny charming satirical or interesting here it really is just a trail mix bag of assorted Disney properties I'm look at this obsessive fan interrogating baby Groot he could ask something really funny but instead he asked if Groot is a descendant of a tree Red Skull mentioned one time that literally no one has ever thought about and he asks it so aggressively like they had the pieces for a really funny interaction but they needed a more ridiculous obsessive question from this guy the joke is really half-baked also Wow baby Groot remember when he was relevant for one movie three years ago I'm sure if this movie came out today they totally still would have used baby Groot and not any other baby from a subsidiary owned by Disney none whatsoever God everything about this movie is just so dated it's less than two years old and it already feels dated I don't understand how you managed that for a movie so obsessed with trends and trying to stay relevant in the digital age it really doesn't hold up and like imagine watching this in ten years imagine seeing the references the fortnight Chewbacca dad screaming goats all that pantry and thinking is this what our culture was like and the first Ralph's movie simply wasn't like this eight years later it doesn't feel like it's aged at all it's a simple love letter to arcade gaming and it has some incredibly endearing characters in a charming story and fun world nothing about this movie's world is fun or charming were there any memorable locations you would love to visit were there any non musical sequences that sparked your imagination or filled you with a sense of wonder and amazement if Sora Donald and Goofy were told that instead of crossing the ocean with Moana and Maui or helping Nick and Judi solve a case they had to enter the internet and visit a Disney fan page in order to raise enough money for a steering wheel would that really be a world you'd be excited to play maybe you would I don't know I don't care frankly all I know is that for me this movie killed the magic of Disney it distilled the very essence of the brand into safe corporate schlock that only barely recaptures the heart and soul of the original in short one-off sequences it's a movie with good intentions buried underneath all the cynicism and laziness but it fails to properly develop its message due to its insistence on dumbing down its characters to an asinine degree it exists as a brand extension first and a film second not once ever justifying its existence as a follow-up to wreck-it Ralph or a piece of the Walt Disney Animation Studios catalog at best it's an impressively animated direct-to-dvd sequel but even that's kind of an insult to some of the better direct-to-dvd sequels it's really just a slightly less cynical version of ready player one or the emoji movie but it doesn't get nearly as much flak for some reason maybe people are just too attached to these characters to realize how bastardize they are in this film or maybe they just like getting Disney references shoveled into their face with no rhyme or reason who knows who cares I'm just done I'm done getting my hopes up that any Disney film will be exceptional or even just good at the bare minimum Ralph breaks the internet broke me the future of animation is in the hands of Netflix Lika maybe even Sony look to the innovators of the medium and get stoked for the passionate projects they're putting out and if Disney or Pixar could still squeeze out a great film I'll be happy good for them but greatness is starting to become the exception not the rule but you know what I'm gonna make the most out of this bad movie situation maybe if I make an amazing phenomenal professional-looking website Ralph and vanellope will go to it in wreck-it Ralph three wouldn't that be radical and the best way to make

418,jBxYZqLLmM4,2018-11-23T16:00:12Z,This Ralph Breaks the Internet review is old and no longer accurate,"This movie ain't great kiddos, and I'm not sure why I didn't see it coming

Twitter: https://twitter.com/Schaffrillas
Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Schaffrillas",so for the longest time I thought Ralph breaks the internet was gonna suck the trailer showed no signs of a discernible plot and it looked like it was just gonna be Disney references the movie I really had no anticipation for it but then started getting really good reviews so I was mildly excited since I love these characters and apparently I learned nothing for the last two times this happened because yeah this movie is just kind of black it wasn't really all that funny and it didn't really captivate me for the majority of the runtime with that said it's actually got quite a few good elements buried underneath all the mediocrity but since those are a bit spoilery I'll talk about them a little later down the line first let's talk about how Ralph is a massive idiotic [ __ ] he does incredibly stupid things in this movie that have pretty major consequences at two different points and he's gratefully called out on it the second time it happens but like why are you so stupid dude honestly you put so many lives in danger without thinking about the consequences multiple times and like I don't know I feel like Ralph's in the first movie wouldn't have done that and yeah this movie's depiction of the Internet isn't really super creative both the world itself and the jokes they come up with are super safe and predictable there's a visual reference to fortnight in this movie I'm not joking Wow that won't be horribly dated in two years see oh my Disney scene was so shoehorned in and painful to sit through the princess scene was good I'm glad I saw 80% of that scene in the trailers at one point Ralph is worried about vanellope exploring on her own and he says that they haven't been apart in six years but like they're a part every day when they both go to their own games at the arcade right and how exactly is Felix covering for Ralph when he's on this adventure last time I checked you need wreck-it Ralph to play fix-it Felix the last time he wasn't there the game was deemed broken how does this make sense also there's a plot point that revolves around Ralph making 27001 dollars by putting out countless buzz Tube videos and eight hours and getting a ton of ad revenue for him like that's not on the internet works Ralph was lucky to have that first mediocre video go viral so quickly but the idea that all of his painfully averaged videos gained a similar amount of success in such a short time span and that they made him thousands of dollars in one day is laughable I mean honestly I wish Buzz - it was real because if that was how YouTube work I'd be a goddamn billion right now and chances are you would be - I do have to say though one of Ralphs viral videos is friggin hysterical and if you've seen the movie you know exactly which one I'm talking about I'm not gonna spoil it for anyone but that's that I'm gonna get into other spoilers from here on out three-two-one penguin first of all there's a song number that really subverted my expectations yippee I said the magic words I had to mention it here because I really enjoyed it it was definitely not expecting it and yeah that's all I'll say so after two-thirds of the movie being Ralph and vanellope going on random disjointed internet adventures and Ralph's being an [ __ ] the movie starts getting really good when vanellope calls ralph out and throws the hero necklace off a cliff and that's the part where I realized holy crap I'm actually watching a real movie right now I totally forgot so that's investing but then this virus that Ralph Unleashed copies Ralph's insecurities and makes a bunch of creepy mindless Ralph's zombies who then form a giant horrifying Ralph's monster that chases after vanilla pee that's really goddamn brilliant like the Ralph monster is the movie's antagonist because the conflict in the film stems from Ralph's insecurities about losing his best friends it's genius and it's made even better by just what an abomination this Ralph monster really is I'm not overselling it this might be the scariest thing in a Disney movie since like Satan and Fantasia it's also great because there's no twist villain hallelujah the conflict doesn't stem from some forced outside force driving a wedge between the two main characters it's just the relatable fact that they're going in different directions in life I love that the movie ends with Ralph letting vanellope go live out her dreams and slaughter race friends have different dreams it's realistic and profound it's such a brilliant culmination for this movie to be built upon but honestly that doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being bland unfunny manipulative and uninspired I'm sorry I really tried to like this one but it lacks the cohesive compelling story of the first despite having a better message it's so frustrating to see a movie that does have something profound to say about friendships and letting your friends go in the pain that comes along with that but having that message get buried underneath all this mediocrity this movie made me feel more than Incredibles too but I think I like that one better overall at least it has cool action and genuine funny moments this for me is probably Disney's weakest offering this decade much like big hero 6 I will at least acknowledge that Ralph breaks the Internet is a movie but I don't think it's a movie I'll remember in a week's time it's bland and forgettable despite the best efforts of these lovable characters and talented voice actors before I go though I should mention that there are two post credits scenes and their brilliance the first one answers the exact question I had at the end of this movie and the second one is just honestly I'm just so glad it exists the Disney animated it that makes me happy but at the end of the day taking everything about this movie into account I'm gonna have to give it a 10 out of 10 for referencing our Lord and Savior Tama Toa everybody praised the crab Lord hallelujah now but really it's a 6 out of 10 at least there was an attempt at making a real movie in the last third it was just too little too late and now for a special sneak peak at sharp talk to [Music]

J.K. Simmons portrayal of Terence Fletcher will forever be one of the most terrifying and chilling representations of the mental stress a teacher can put on a student.  Terence Fletcher is a manipulative and sociopathic teacher at a top music school, using his tactics to bend the will of his students into what he believes is greatness.  Whiplash would not hold the weight it does without Terence Fletcher's insanity on screen.

behaviors as coming off as a man who was just trying to get the best out of his students explaining it away with an inflated rumor about two famous jazz musicians terence fletcher is representative of the horrors that can occur when a malignant abuser finds himself in a position of power and left unchecked if i ever find one of these lying around again i swear to god i will stop being so polite get the out of my sight before i demolish you whiplash is a 2014 oscar-winning drama starring miles teller and j.k simmons written and directed by damian chazelle the film follows an ambitious young music student andrew nieman as he navigates the inherent pressures of working his way up the ladder as a drummer at new york's most competitive music academy he eventually ends up under the instruction of the conductor of the school's competing studio band terence fletcher a teacher who goes to an extreme length to get the most out of his students student-teacher relationships are a crucial part of our development as human beings outside of our immediate family our teachers can be some of the most influential people in our lives this is what makes films like dead poets society and school of rock so impactful the student-teacher relationship is something that we all connect with on a personal level this is even more true when you think about higher education as young students begin to hone in on what it is they want to contribute to in this world they rely on the instruction and advice of their professor to guide them into their careers in whiplash the character of andrew neiman wants greatness and he wants to become the next buddy rich and all these wants drives and skills are set up perfectly during the film's opening scene we can see his focus and determination we see his passion when fletcher enters the room he uses the phrase you know who i am we understand that terence fletcher is at the top of some sort of power structure within the confines of schaefer academy and that whoever he is it's important for andrew to impress him this is where terence fletcher's manipulation of andrew neiman begins abusers who are good at what they do spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out what people want before embarking on their quest to bend them to their will when you put these people into an environment like a music school these abusers no longer have to do any work whatsoever in figuring out what people desire just the fact that andrew neiman was accepted into the schaefer academy of music tells someone like terence fletcher everything they need to know about what the student actually wants the fact that this kid is up late practicing on drums tells fletcher that he is willing to do whatever it takes to succeed at what he does and those two things add up to something incredibly exploitable the thing that makes terence fletcher so terrifying to us as viewers is that he seems to have a purpose for being so terrible everything terence fletcher does in this film is a performance centered around one thing and one thing only manipulating his students into delivering the best performance possible when terence fletcher finally invites neiman to join the studio band he tells him to show up to rehearsal at 6am when the rehearsal didn't even start until 9am fletcher doesn't even care as to whether or not neiman is there at 6am or not but neiman does this is an early opening move in fletcher's attempts to bend neiman to his will during this initial rehearsal scene we catch our first glimpse of terence fletcher's abusive tactics when he intimidates a student into a false confession of being out of tune after humiliating the student and kicking him out of the band fletcher then reveals that not knowing whether or not you're out of tune is an even bigger problem for the record metz wasn't not a tune you were erickson but he didn't know and that's bad enough this is the music academy equivalent to a public execution the one in which an innocent victim was punished for something he didn't even really do in the first place this entire situation feels like one of terence fletcher's ways of establishing his dominance over neiman before putting him on the drums to see what he can do during a break fletcher approaches neiman and starts casually probing him about his personal life this all seems very pleasant but he's really just utilizing charm to disarm neiman this is another abusive tactic known as love bombing in which an abuser attempts to influence a person through demonstrations of attention or affection there's a key moment in this dialogue in which terence fletcher asks neiman parents musicians no what do they do from the outside it seems like fletcher is asking this so he can throw it back in his face later but this question is really the moment in which fletcher realizes that he can do whatever he wants to andrew neiman without any ties to the music industry fletcher understands that neiman is reliant on his approval alone to achieve what he wants thus opening the door for fletcher to basically operate from a position of total authority over his career trajectory once neiman gets onto the drum set fletcher continues the seemingly supportive persona that he adopted in the hallway he even goes so far as to call neiman buddy rich if you recall the opening scene of the film neiman has a picture of buddy rich on the wall of his rehearsal space this is fletcher appealing to neiman's drive and motivation before completely tearing it away during some of neiman's drum fills fletcher stops him and begins informing him that he is not drumming at the tempo he wants him to play a little trouble there this is where the tactic of withdrawing comes into play the emotional high neiman received from fletcher validating him in the hallway is slowly being replaced with disappointment and inside a human mind this tactic causes chemical reactions akin to coming down from a really potent drug fletcher then begins moving the goal posts back and forth for neiman creating an unreachable target this is an extremely concentrated version of yet another manipulation tactic called crazy making the goal of which is to make the victim doubt their own abilities and or sanity so that you can further warp their view of the world later on creating this impossible tempo to reach frustrates and terrifies neiman who at this point is just a sweet kid trying his hardest to impress his instructor this continues back and forth until a physical threat presents itself why do you suppose i just hurled a chair at your head neiman neiman supposes it's the tempo this is fletcher basically screaming look what you made me do that's someone he is currently abusing a now stunned neiman begins to flounder over his speech sweat and become completely and utterly nerve-wracked and this is where fletcher goes in for the kill and begins physically assaulting neiman in front of the entire ensemble this 50 year old man is literally beating his tempo into this 19 year old psyche while screaming in his face humiliation is the next tactic fletcher uses to break neiman and when he finally begins crying fletcher knows that he has succeeded at what he intended to do in the first place which was to completely and utterly break his student down to tears and then embarrass him in front of the entire ensemble before removing him from the drums he is stripping neiman of his humanity in an effort to mold him into the type of musician he wants him to be which was the goal from the moment he announced he'd be placing him on the drums in the first place neiman is completely and utterly broken and the next time we see him he is practicing the drums until his hands literally bleed if you delve deep enough into any artistic or athletic pursuit you will find some fringe mentalities on how arts and athletics should be approached there seem to be a theme of needing to suffer greatly in order to generate a desired outcome in performance the no pain no gain mentality has been passed down onto generations for centuries and the idea that in order to achieve greatness a person must be broken down and stripped of all their dignity before proceeding with their career trajectory is not unheard of while whiplash takes this mentality to extreme and brutal levels damien chazelle is trying to show us that these tactics have a lasting impact on a young and fragile psyche he's telling us that these practices can begin to erode someone's self-perception and cause immense harm in just a few small moments after terence fletcher's assault we then observe andrew nieman's downward spiral into a pattern of unhealthy behaviors that end up alienating him from his family friends and romantic pursuits throughout the movie all of that is born from his introductory scene in the studio band's rehearsal room he triangulates neiman again by bringing another drummer in to compete for his spot on the band forcing three different drummers to play for countless hours until the studio drum set is soaked in blood he imbues andrew neiman with so much pressure anxiety and toxicity that at one point he leaves the scene of a serious car accident in which he was severely injured just to make it to a performance on time terence fletcher is a truly terrifying character he is a sadistic perfectionist hellbent on using verbal mental and physical abuse on young adults to force them into doing exactly what he wants jk simmons delivers a performance that is rich with subtleties and the choices he makes in bringing terence fletcher to life are uncanny in the hands of a lesser performer terence fletcher could come off as seemingly stereotypical but the more you observe the nuanced layers simmons brings to life through his eye movements and facial tics the more you discover you begin to see the inner workings of a victimizing maniac play out through the veneer of a passionate teacher in the mind of terence fletcher all of his abuses and manipulations are justified because he's trying to inspire greatness and there's nothing more terrifying than a narcissistic sociopath

421,kunUvYIJtHM,2015-11-17T22:57:36Z,Whiplash Script vs Screen,"As discussed on episode 224 of the Scriptnotes podcast, this scene from Damien Chazelle's Whiplash shows how the conflict was built on the page, and details that changed during filming and editing. 

You can find the episode here: http://johnaugust.com/2015/whiplash-on-paper-and-on-screen

Pay particular attention to verb tenses. Fletcher (JK Simmons) moves a lot of things into the past. 

A big chunk is lifted from the back half of the scene, likely because it doesn't focus directly on Andrew and Fletcher's relationship in the present and future.

You can find the Scriptnotes podcast on iTunes.

424,Xt9GKLOqrZI,2023-09-05T03:53:57Z,We really need to talk about this ship...,I'll take a look at the Brand New New Republic frigate from the Ahsoka series. All that and more for today's video!,I find ahsoka's new warship really interesting the new Republic is in an era when they're supposedly disarming however we see in three episodes probably over a dozen of these ships being built at corellia and mass Corp formation with home one these are clearly a new class of ship as well as alluded to by Hera in episode 1. It's actually kind of interesting I think these vessels bear most of the Hallmarks of the new Republic's Navy post the Battle of Endor for one they seem to be very well designed and efficient that's something we've been hearing since the Radice was introduced in episode 8 but I also noticed that the thing while armed is an absolutely bristling with weapons we see some cannons at the top there's probably some others we can't see instead the ship seems to be largely focused on Starfighter carrying it's got four pretty large hangers which can probably each hold comfortably between a half to a full Squadron of starfighters without feeling cramped so in true New Republic fashion we've got a Russell probably designed by the mon calamari with top of the line technology which serves really as more of a flexible Fleet carrier rather than a high-powered combat platform like the Star Destroyer we still don't know the length we don't know the name as I mentioned I'm guessing it's about seven to 850 meters long I'm going to call it the mon calamari assault for again

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",this is actually crazy but it's been confirmed by Disney that the Lando Calrissian TV series is now being developed as a movie adding to what seems like a vast roster of Star Wars movies currently being developed Donald Glover who's going to play Lando in the movie and is developing the project alongside his brothers said I would love to play Lando again it's a fun time being him just has to be the right way to do it time is precious the past couple of years the pandemic it really had people experience time people realize their time is valuable they only get so much I'm not interested in doing anything that's going to be a waste of my time or just a paycheck I'd much rather spend time with people that I enjoy it just has to be the right thing and I think it could be Lando is definitely somebody I want to hang out with so clearly he's passionate about developing this project and is going to have a largely Hands-On role in doing so that said it now it seems like there are so many Star Wars films in development and no indication of when the first one is going to be released alongside the three new Star Wars films that Disney revealed are being developed at Star Wars celebration this year including the film about Ray rebuilding the Jedi Order Dave flony's film involving Ahsoka thrawn the Mandalorian all of his characters and the film about the origins of the Jedi not to mention Sean Levy Star Wars film taikua TD Star Wars film and now this 
428,cxFqbLxoCPA,2023-09-17T02:47:39Z,Literally NO ONE has talked about this,I want to talk about the Rodian Pilot featured in The Mandalorian Season 3 who has also seemingly appeared in Ahsoka Season One. We'll talk about that on today's Star Wars video!,one of the main things I've been wondering about Ahsoka season one is pretty simple when does it take place and a lot of this stems from a conversation with sabine's actress where she said in an interview with total film that Ahsoka happens at the same time as Mando season three now that's mostly interesting to me because of the references to thrawn but I've also been wondering in particular because I think it's possible that thrawn returns and kills Carson Teva alongside the small New Republic Fleet which is currently stationed at cetos well I need your guys's opinion on this but I think they may have given us the answer in the finale for The Mandalorian season 3 we see a green rodent maybe even using the Greedo mask itself in Ahsoka season 1 as the eye of Sion jumps to hyperspace we see a rhodian pilot die now the question is is this the same individual I will note that the rodian pilot in Ahsoka does have a little bit of extra coloration around their eyes but that could be quite simply something they did to make the alien mask look better in close-up shots rodians are fairly unique and I think having two very similar looking ones within the Adelphi spacers or the Adelphi Squadron it's just too much of a coincidence so yeah I think this is probably meant to be the same alien which tells us that we're now in the future but that's just my opinion I look forward to hearing yours down below 
429,-vNTl6p1gXI,2023-09-11T03:53:49Z,Why this scene was SO awesome,"The final scene of Ahsoka Episode 4 was really, really cool as we see the massive Eye of Sion ripping a hole intro hyperspace and off to another Galaxy. We'll break down some of the more important details on today's Star Wars Ahsoka video!",honestly one of my favorite parts of the most recent episode of Ahsoka was the ending scenes with the eye of Sion not only were the shots of it slowly Rising through Sea toss's Cloud Lair super cinematic and cool but I thought the actual hyperspace jump was very interesting the show has spent a lot of time establishing that the eye of Scion is perhaps unlike any other ship in Star Wars history the thing is powered despite its I mean comparatively small size by several Superstar Destroyer engines it makes sense it has to travel probably hundreds of thousands if not millions of light years one thing I really loved is how the ship ripped through space after making that final hyperspace jump and I do kind of wonder whether that may be more than just a neat visual feature one aspect of Star Wars that we've seen in the past especially in expanded universe novels is the fact that hyperspace exit routes can be used to make a rough guess regarding a ship's Transit so sort of a very basic hyperspace tracking with this giving off all that extra information and the ghost being present is it possible that the new Republic could recreate and discover the hyperspace route taken by L Smith and the others either way I think the visual of just it being such a powerful unique hyperdrive was really cool but those are my thoughts let me know yours down below

No frame is left untouched. No character model is left with subpar lighting. Simply put, after playing for 3 hours, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 looks set to continue Insomniac’s winning streak. This is IGN's Spider-Man 2 Preview.

#IGN #Gaming #SpiderMan",foreign [Music] Marvel's Spider-Man 2 takes everything Insomniac learned from its previous two Spider-Man games and finds new ways to raise the bar of superhero game design no frame is left untouched no character model is left with subpar lighting simply put after playing for three hours Marvel Spider-Man 2 looks set to continue insomniac's winning streak hey Doc ready for your annual physical we were dropped the ways into the game on level 25 versions of Miles Morales and Peter Parker each is dealing with their own difficulties in life with Peter trying to pay a mortgage and help cure his friend's disease while miles is simply trying to write his college essay but spider business keeps distracting him from the task at hand Craven how many more people are on this guy's list besides the personal battles being fought by Peter and Miles there are also other factors at play that will push them further to the edge Parker is Don the symbiote suit known as Venom and it's affecting his personality in ways he doesn't realize we're going to heal and Craven is doing everything he can to upset the Peace by attacking Peter and forcing Dr Connors to transform into an even more powerful version of his alter ego the lizard the Dr Connor's storyline is particularly Bittersweet as you're really hunting down a father who wants nothing more than to return to his family but now he'll be doing so with a few Spider-Man and crave and inflicted injuries this fight will actually take you across a large portion of New York City that Insomniac boasts is two times larger than the previous games taking full advantage of the PS5 Spider-Man 2 will allow you to travel across the city faster than ever not only because of the Zippy new web slinging animations but also because of the web wings that you can access at any time with the Press of the triangle button web wings are a lot of fun to use versus swinging but they will lose momentum over time so you will need to use your webs unless you're in a wind tunnel the wind tunnels will let you go to specific places in the city extremely fast by flying incredibly quickly to that destination on the air current but in addition to all these traversal options Insomniac showed that you can also simply swap to Peter or miles on the Fly instantaneously Allah swapping between Trevor Franklin and Michael in Grand Theft Auto 5. Marvel Spider-Man 2 will introduce the ability to switch between the two wall crawlers in the open world and thanks to the power of the PlayStation 5 you can make that switch almost instantly I had the opportunity to ask the Insomniac team about how the PS5 SSD allowed them to accomplish instant travel and faster web swinging Mike Fitzgerald core technology director at Insomniac clarified a few other details including the fact that the slingshots were Peter or miles will pull back on two extended webs and catapult themselves forward allows Spider-Man to travel three times faster than in the first game and that characters are more detailed and lifelike that help them tell better more nuanced stories Insomniac also noted that the Dual sense controller is being used in some unique ways like a mini game that we got to play in the reactor that will force you to pull the triggers with just enough pressure to move on to the next segment and they outline that the audio team took the time to develop the soundscapes for Missions so that 3D audio can be fully utilized ambisonics and positional audio were used for objects in the scene making for a more realistic audio experience making for clearer indications of the player versus a Target location I'm the only one more notably on the graphic side of things Spider-Man 2 will only have two visual modes Visual and performance the third mode was removed because no matter which you choose Ray tracing will be turned on by default the Baseline for performance mode will be what was previously referred to as performance Ray tracing mode with a better frame rate and resolution simply because the PS5 can handle it Fitzgerald clarifies there's no mode in this game that has the ray tracing turned off because there's really no need for it we figured out how to deliver what is the right Spider-Man picture and visuals and we want to make sure every player is seeing that the visuals of Spider-Man 2 are impressive the character models are more expressive when delivering their lines resulting in more believable performances from the actors that will in turn do a better job of pulling at your heartstrings the ray traced Reflections add more depth and realism to the world breakable environmental additions make it feel like you've succeeded in unleashing havoc in an area after a devastating combo but my favorite Improvement Spider-Man 2 is the heavily reworked combat now both Peter and Miles have a wide array of abilities and gadgets at their disposal but more on that in a moment while I was exploring in the open world there were several different Mission types to see meaning that yet again we will have no shortage of side missions to get lost in personally I will always favor the combat Arenas and I spent so much time enjoying them that I lost track of time and never got to experience the aforementioned lizard boss fight for myself I was too busy trying to perfect my combat skills in the arena gawking at the ray traced Reflections on everything staring in awe at the sheer amount of traffic pedestrians and puddles in every scene or stopping an assault in progress as it popped up yeah that was the best part New York is covered in cool things to do with Spider-Man and while I could have pursued the main storyline with my limited time I was just having too much fun doing all the other little things that pulled my attention away Insomniac also noted that there will be missions that only miles or Peter can complete so it sounds like my quest to clear the map is going to be filled with variety but to dive into combat a bit more the enemy density is really ramped up and will sometimes offer you a bit more of a challenge than you may expect in Spider-Man you could maybe get away with using your main attacks but in Spider-Man 2 I found that more often than not I absolutely needed to use my Venom abilities and Gadgets in the combat sections the one small critique I have is that the new not dodgeable Parry indicator color is red and that's the same color as other things you need to dodge like a bullet from a rooftop sniper it took a bit of getting used to but by the end of my demo window I was parrying and unleashing my gadgets and Venom abilities with ease and before getting into combat if you're still undetected you can use web lines to Traverse a battlefield and I love the layer this adds as you're taking out enemies in the stage saw a couple Gadget wise we only had access to the web grabber which we've seen before an upshot which would attack opponents with bursts of electricity miles also had access to Venom abilities like chain lightning power overwhelming or the Venom smash jolt those attacks and gadgets are very easy to execute by simply holding L1 for Venom abilities or R1 for fast Gadget access and that makes combat incredibly fluid it will also Force players to pick and choose the strongest combinations eight to pair together as you Patrol the streets of Manhattan Brooklyn and Queens we also got a look at the Symbiote surge basically Peter goes into rage mode a la god of war and wrecks everything in the vicinity there's a cooldown on it just like rage mode and God of War so after you've attacked everybody for a little bit the timer will wear out and you'll have to rely on your core abilities the cherry on top of an already impressive gameplay session was when they let us get a sneak peek at some of the new costumes that Peter and miles will be able to wear when Webb slinging around the city in total Insomniac says there are 65 suits to unlock and that each has different variations bringing the grand total to 200 different combinations you can wear in the build we saw miles had a 2099 10th anniversary murakua an encoded suit while Peter had the classic black suit web black suit from the Sam Raimi films secret war Civil War suit and apocalyptic suit available for wearing and for the suit Tech upgrades your classic Health damage focus and traversal perks were available with the latter option focusing on things like web speed with your web wings I had high hopes for Spider-Man 2 and this preview did nothing to stifle my optimism I cannot wait to see what the rest of Spider-Man 2 has in store for our final thoughts swing on back to IGN when Spider-Man 2 launches this October thank you

#videoessay #review #moviereview #tomcruise",a year after the global success of top gun Maverick Tom Cruise is back putting Cinema goers on his shoulders and dragging us to the promised land he's not the cinema savior we deserve but he's the one we need right now he's been a mega star for decades but who would have thought that a 5'7 60 year old Scientologist [Applause] the person responsible for bringing out the biggest crowds and keeping the theater going experience alive last year he resurrected the Top Gun IP with one of the best films of the year and audiences responded to the tune of 1.5 billion dollars plus at the box office and an Academy Award nomination for best picture this year he strikes again with the seventh yes seventh installment of the mission impossible franchise Mission Impossible dead reckoning part 1. it's an absolute Banger of a movie that's the best time in the theater you'll have all year it continues the mission impossible Legacy of being the quintessential popcorn action movie dead reckoning is Thoroughly entertaining never lulls is shot exquisitely by season director Christopher Macquarie with the steady acting hand of Tom Cruise and co-stars on the screen this one comes highly recommended if you like to have fun there's an idea of an earnestly made movie when filmmakers give you exactly what you expect from them when their intent shines through on the screen the last few years Tom Cruise and Company have been delivering bring that in Spades and they've been a beacon of light during an era of Hollywood when they're reliant on the safest bet possible meaning we receive mostly Bland boring or outright awful films made without any desire to balance Commerce with art dead reckoning provided exactly what I needed a great time at the theater with literal edge of my seat moments and something that actually felt like it was worth the price of admission which is hard to come by in modern times Tom Cruise might come off a bit eccentric in real life but if I had to pick one person in the world to call a born Entertainer it would be him he's given some wonderful performances throughout his illustrious career in a wide range of genres my favorite performance of his is easily the supporting role in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia and he showed off his comedic chops as the disgusting producer in Tropic Thunder my fist is going to be so far up your that every time you have a thought it's past my wedding ring but he's also one of the greatest action film stars of all time up there in my book with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keanu Reeves if we are talking exclusively Hollywood Productions there's something distinct here in my opinion Schwarzenegger has some of the best action movies of all time under his belt with predator in the first two Terminators and Keanu has the original Matrix movie as well as a couple greats with speed in the 90s and the original John Wick I wouldn't consider anything Tom Cruise has been in to be one of the greatest of its genre on an individual film level but the mission impossible franchise as a whole is so consistently entertaining it's one of the best action franchises ever that's a testament to Cruz's commitment to his craft let's face it with five directors and seven entries this franchise is what it is because of Tom Cruise besides the enduring draw of Cruz the Mi series is known for spectacular action sequences involving some elevated endearing stunts and increasingly intense set pieces as the movies progress mostly performed by or involving Tom occurs himself the man is renowned for doing most of his own stunts making the films feel more authentic and exactly what I'm looking for and earnestness in the craft and while it's a popcorn movie franchise to the max they also have some pretty engaging story lines they follow a formula set from the original television show the franchise is based on where our hero Ethan's presented with a new mission to kick off the story that flows through twists and unexpected Revelations den Reckoning maintains that consistency that might have reached a fever pitch with 2018's Mission Impossible Fallout if you enjoyed that one this one's definitely for you while Fallout was the conclusion of a three-part story dead reckoning continues the high octane action Intrigue and clever twists and turns dead reckoning follows Ethan Hunt once again this time set on a mission to find two pieces of a key that can disable a rogue artificial intelligence that's become sentient every major power on the planet is attempting to find the key because whoever controls the AI known as The Entity will essentially have the power to control the world Ethan assembles his team team of Benny Luther and Ilse Faust and along the way crosses paths with a thief named Grace played by Haley Atwell in her Mission Impossible debut who has also been tasked with acquiring the key now let's get one thing straight the action in this movie is incredible then Reckoning continues the mission impossible tradition of unreal set pieces in international locations meaning each action sequence has its own distinct Flair and style Tom Cruise might be starting to look his age and that's okay because he looks pretty damn amazing for 60 years old but regardless of that it seems like nothing is slowing him down there's something really unique knowing that it's him doing all of this crazy  jumping off a motorcycle after leaping off a cliff and parachuting onto a moving train car chases car crashes and horse chases it's a thrilling experience and the use of exotic locations adds an incredible backdrop to the stunts and action sequences giving dead reckoning as well as previous films in the franchise an enormous Global Blockbuster feel without having to resort to CGI and let let's face it when it comes to Danger we know Ethan is going to make it and that shouldn't be shocking because it literally says part one in the title but even so I was still on the edge of my seat multiple times seeing it in IMAX surely enhances the Thrills but it's never about is Ethan going to live or die it's more about how is he going to get out of this one there's a huge dedication to the craft of filmmaking going on behind the scenes to bring all of this insane stuff to the screen there's a ton of behind the scenes footage Paramount Pictures released over the past several months revealing the bike jump alone is one of the biggest stunts in cinema history with filming it so complex that the cameras used weren't even available just two years prior that level of dedication is something normally reserved for the likes of James Cameron who pushes the boundaries of special effects in VFX but with Cruz and Macquarie they're trying to push things to the max in reality not behind a computer screen oh and they actually made an entertaining movie unlike Avatar 2. macquarie's more in line with the Christopher Nolan School of filmmaking if you can do it for real then do it for real it's a pleasure to get away from the Marvel Cinematic Universe brand of CGI infested blurred hollowed out visuals to have something on the screen that's tangible that really exists that really happened and was caught on film not something filmed against the green screen and passed off to an overworked VFX artist to do their magic because nothing can replace the real thing this movie had a budget on par with an MCU movie but its cost increased exponentially when the pandemic struck with multiple delays happening requiring filmmaking to take place over multiple shooting periods a far cry from a Marvel movie that can be filmed and dumped off to have the rest generated in a computer speaking of computers the core of the plot centers around artificial intelligence run amok threatening the world these things can go either way between cringe and good depending on how it's handled but I think the delays in filming might have actually benefited the film Mission Impossible is always over the top not fast and furious level over the top but pretty extraordinary nonetheless and when the AI AKA The Entity was introduced I was worried for a second but honestly with the introduction of chat gbt and the floor chain and expanding use of artificial intelligence over the past several months this concept doesn't seem remotely far-fetched at all now it seems like a natural progression of reality that the series is following when it comes to dealing with real world Concepts The Entity is able to take control of electronics at any time which is a great concept on paper but could be used as a storytelling crutch thankfully the script is smart with the way this is utilized giving it some form of boundaries so it never seems overused or contrived when it's implemented outside of AI we do have humans the cast for the Mi movies have always been great and dead reckoning part 1 is no different I mean what else can I say about Tom Cruise he's the man this dude is a National Treasure and it'll be a sad day when he's too old to do the patented Tom Cruise run across the screen but it doesn't look like we're going to be seeing that day anytime soon he's so damn famous it's hard to see him as anyone other than Tom Cruise but for what it's worth He embodies the character of Ethan Hunt and this series simply doesn't exist without him whether we're talking about behind the scenes or on the screen Haley Atwell makes a great addition to the cast and her character Grace is cheeky in all the right ways she's not the annoying kind of strong female character that Hollywood loves to try and shove down everyone's throats in modern times everything she's capable of doing makes sense it's explained and she's a fully formed character it's great to see Haley Atwell in a larger role that isn't an independent film or the character Peggy Carter she deserves to be a huge star and it would be odd to have a mission impossible movie without Ving Rhames and the man the myth the legend is here where he belongs he plays great off of Simon Peg's Benji and after multiple films together their chemistry is obvious essay Morales plays Gabriel the new antagonist for the dead reckoning films and so far in part 1 he delivers a solid performance he's particularly menacing in a few scenes but there's nothing extraordinary about Gabriel so far it's a mission impossible movie so he's perfectly comic bookie in nature and he has a connection to Ethan's past which will surely be explored a bit more in part two but so far he's a serviceable villain that isn't really wowing me isai Morales is a great actor who's appeared as a supporting role or villain in a number of movies and TV shows over decades so I hope he has something more to sink his teeth into in part two unfortunately for the Mission Impossible series there will never be anyone who can top Philip Seymour Hoffman's villainous turn as Owen Davison in part three easily the greatest antagonist in the franchise's history and one of my favorite screen villains ever it's hard to contend with one of the finest actors to ever live but asai Morales character of Gabriel still has room to become more menacing dead reckoning's directorial choices by Macquarie are confusing at times if you haven't seen the previous entries interestingly a number of test screenings were reportedly by a younger generation of people who had never seen any Mission Impossible films a reminder that Cruz has been playing Ethan Hunt for almost 30 years in Macquarie uses a lot of Dutch camera angles and techniques throughout the movie which I thought was an odd Choice until I realized it's a bit of a throwback to the original movie directed by Brian De Palma zapalma used the same camera angles frequently throughout his illustrious career and it stood out to me a lot in the first Mi movie Macquarie emulates the Palma's style using the camera angles to increase tension in dramatic scenes but he sticks to his own beautiful shooting style when filming action there's the scene wrapping up the second act that felt like a visual throwback to the original movie too reminding me of the scene when kittrich confronts Ethan in the restaurant one of the most famous scenes in the franchise when he's jumping away from the exploding fish tank yes exploding fish tank all this is done without any form of nostalgia baiting these things are subtle not forced at all and are more there for long-term fans without interfering with the story or stopping to hit the viewer over the head with member berries while dead reckoning is only half of the story with part 2 scheduled to release next summer it still holds its own as an excellent entry no it doesn't stand on its own because we're missing conclusion here but it doesn't suffer the same issues a lot of cliffhanger entries and franchises do Captain Jack Sparrow was swallowed by the Kraken Han Solo was encased in carbonite Neo was trapped in the train station these sort of moves leave you wondering what is happening to the hero and still needing a conclusion to the main story but with dead reckoning there's a satisfying ending to the film while we're waiting for a conclusion basically what I'm getting at is that nearly every aspect of this movie was well thought out planned and executed and it's going to absolutely dominate the rest of the summer and it's going to dominate for the same reasons top gun Maverick did because it's a no agenda no honest-to-goodness entertaining movie it's bizarre that this kind of movie is so few and far between admittedly when it comes to Independent films there are some great great movies that come out every single year last year Pearl was my favorite movie hands down and that cost a million and a half dollars to make but when it comes to Big Blockbusters they're made in every way possible that audiences simply aren't responding to anymore it's like big budget movies are made on a conveyor belt there's so much riding on their success that everything feels sanitized neutered completely stripped of anything worthwhile and coming out as Hollow low brow pieces of look how well Disney's done this year it melt the Nostalgia bait for a few years before reality has hit them in the face losing nearly a billion dollars at the box office over the last year on top of that modern Blockbuster films feel the need to fill in a diversity quota or push some sort of political agenda forward into their films emphasizing these things more than good storytelling least of all emphasizing great filmmaking it's a perfect storm of crap and that's why movies like Indiana Jones and the dial of Destiny bombed a few weeks ago why Little Mermaid was a stinker and a money loser yet a film like top gun Maverick and John Wick 4 blast off at the box office and critical success Mission Impossible dead reckoning is in the same ballpark because Tom Cruise and Company and extremely diverse cast have no interest in pushing agendas into their films they are here to entertain you take a look at Haley atwell's character she's not the modern idea of a strong independent woman and what I mean by that is she's not a character who's smarter better and one-ups the main character we actually paid to see with no Rhyme or Reason other than it's a writer self-insert no she's incredibly intelligent Swift clever and gets the better of Ethan a few times but she has limits she can't do all the things Ethan can do because literally no one can it helps developer into a real character instead of some Hollow entity written in by a screenwriter every character's backstory paints a portrait of who they are and why they are capable of doing what they're doing there's no Ray Palpatine anywhere to be found in dead reckoning there's no one upstaging Ethan Hunt regardless of who it is he's the man we came to the theater to see and that's what we get it's actually pretty wild to think that Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crystal Skull was the same same age as Tom Cruise is in this movie it's like night and day Ford looked and performed great in Crystal Skull despite the movie being trashed don't get me wrong but Cruz is on another level he's still performing and running around the screen like an absolute Maniac at 60 years old it's absolutely unbelievable Mission Impossible 7 is going to be one of the biggest Blockbusters of the year and is about to put Indiana Jones in the dial of Destiny to shame just a few weeks apart it's everything an action movie should be and in a lot of ways everything a movie should be if we boil it down to one word entertaining at two and a half hours I couldn't believe how fast the time had passed I was fully invested in simply having a blast at the movies a relic of a concept in modern times it made me go back and start re-watching the entire series from the start and it's too bad I have to wait an entire year for part two to come out I hope Hollywood continues to take notes from Tom Cruise stop making agenda pushing propaganda and get back to making great movies like this one ggs

#mcu #disney #disneyplus #marvel #marvelstudios #videoessay #moviereview",the mcu's gone from cultural darling to a cautionary tale an example of what happens when you think you're too big to fail at one point it stood as an example of what Chernobyl conveyor belt entertainment could look like when perfected a multi-billion dollar media Monster Under the Umbrella of the Disney Empire even though popular culture has always gone in Cycles the MCU seemed like it might just be one of those things that sticks around in the cultural Zeitgeist forever like James Bond or Godzilla and that could still be the case but if they're still making MCU movies 30 years from now it won't be at the rate of phase four or five I feel like I do this check in on the MCU thing a couple times a year where we update the situation with the latest mess-ups well it's the MCU so shocker it hasn't gone well since the last video time to check in the MCU might not be the highlight of Cinema but I don't think it's as bad as Martin Score says he thinks it is the MCU isn't detrimental to cinema it's not whatever this is to Muse sick [Music] but diminishing interest in the brand means the MCU is more likely to follow in the footsteps of the western or the 80s action era something that was of its time and still makes appearances here and there The Expendables for example but its time as king is coming to an end if anything were to endure like James Bond or Godzilla it might end up being individual superheroes and not the shared Universe concept Batman or Spider-Man are characters that are so popular they'll probably always have an audience and yes I'm sorry to say that means Ant-Man probably won't be joining them but the MCU and superhero movies reigned at the top might be ending sooner rather than later secret Invasion a television series for Disney plus was the latest debacle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but the problems certainly didn't just start there trouble's been brewing since One Division some say even before that but the MCU has been on a steady decline from storytelling taking a sharp turn into lazy predictable writing tropes and stale joke formats to decline winning box office returns in the mcu's first box office Financial loss to floundering critical reception in a cinema Juggernaut quickly losing the patience of a once loyal audience who's fed up with being fed garbage the MCU is barreling down the hill oh thank you little Roots please stay strong the DCU is seeing the same kind of response as the MCU but their situations are different so there's a DCU specific video that's following up this one in the next couple days the MCU has been and continues to be the more powerful brand but 2023 saw Ant-Man and the WASP quantumania become the first MCU movie to lose money at the box office it'll probably eventually make a profit through streaming and Merchandising although I've never met an Ant-Man fan in my life so I don't know who's buying his toys but whatever prior to that black panther wakanda forever underperformed and right before that Thor love and thunder and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness failed to hit a billion after opening to a massive worldwide number strictly because of mixed Word of Mouth over the film's quality Spider-Man no way home was a success along with this year's Guardians of the Galaxy 3 but those movies had actual stories that engage the odd audience and pulled them in and our properties that stand on their own Outside The Wider MCU like I said earlier Spider-Man will always make money and Guardians 3 had a disappointing opening weekend but legged it out to an okay final box office total because a positive word of mouth from fans if it had been the same quality as the majority of MCU projects in the past couple years it would have been in a similar boat to Ant-Man 3. today's sponsor keeps is a subscription service that helps men well keep their hair they offer clinically proven treatments to

cynic or click the link in the description that's k-e-e-p-s.com slash movie cynic Disney plus has been in my opinion nothing but a detriment to the Marvel Brand I understand the idea Disney wanted to get a jump start in the streaming world and the theory is good Marvel and Star Wars are beloved Brands and people can't get enough of them so if you just give a Marvel or Star Wars related TV show a massive budget people will just show up people pay to see Marvel in the theater so people will definitely watch it at home for a monthly subscription fee right it turns out even if it's practically free people won't consume an awful product by virtue of the fact it's just there so what's been happening while Disney plus has been releasing MCU TV show after MCU TV show thinking they would be anchoring down their brand spanking new streaming service and raking in customers well nothing has been happening and that's the problem no one's watching these shows Miss Marvel pulled in less than a million viewers it's debut week secret Invasion the latest MC release debuted to barely over a million to put that in perspective some YouTube videos hit those numbers in less than 20 24 hours secret Invasion had a million people watching it and Ant-Man 3 took a loss at the box office when 10 million people saw it opening weekend and there are over 145 million people with Disney plus and only a million watched it zero people watching a six episode television show that cost over 200 million dollars to make in less than three hours to watch is cause for concern but these shows also aren't any good and that's caused massive damage to the brand the Disney Plus shows have watered down the product making the MCU something less like an event and more like it's at best the thing you throw on in the background but you can't even do that because then you'll have no idea what's going on in this sprawling ever expanding Multiverse speaking of the Multiverse that's one of the many problems the MCO has gotten itself into if the superhero genre is trendy and ends up going the way of the western it'll be because of self-sabotage in an attempt to keep itself relevant both the MCU and DCU have shifted their shared cinematic universes toward the Multiverse meaning they can replace recast or alter characters that were previously played by other actors or move completely out of established timelines and in theory this sounds like a great idea it should mean the MCU can move forward forever because they can just shift the timeline and oh new Captain America but the Multiverse has very quickly become nothing but a breeding ground for terrible lazy writing a place and world or worlds where there are no Stakes because anything can happen and where a character death is meaningless because there's an infinite number of them out there the Multiverse kills any value or weight to the sacrifices of previous Heroes and you just kind of sit there feeling like you're waiting for the in-story soft reboot so you can see Captain America fight Wolverine or something and while that admittedly sounds cool we won't be getting it anytime soon because Disney apparently isn't allowed to recast the X-Men until the actors from the fox films contracts are up in 2026. I think right after end game immediately bringing in the X-Men could have been a possible way way to avoid following the fate of the western and postponed the mcu's decline but they couldn't and decided to go the Multiverse route there are a million forms of entertainment all competing for people's attention all the time the X-Men are a tier level enough to maintain interest but because Disney had to go a different way they went with the c and d-list to Your Heroes to follow up end game in a Multiverse storyline with no Stakes So when you say it like that it sounds like a recipe for a disaster kind of keeping fans around is difficult but bringing them back after they've left is a mountain of a task with budgets astronomically high and fans disinterested at some point those two things will come to a head and without enough people watching it won't be financially viable to keep investing in these projects are you yawning in the middle of this while I'm breaking it down huh because I don't know who but someone told Kevin feige that Marvel and the MCU was a big enough brand that people would show up just for the name by judging by those Miss Marvel viewership numbers that's not true I had made a video last year detailing the importance of Iron Man in the first three phases of the MCU and it's relevant to this conversation of course it's YouTube so that video was demonetized so you most likely haven't seen it so here's a clip to illustrate my point Iron Man was the mcu's anchor and after giving it some thought I realized that's what's been missing from phase four not necessarily Iron Man himself but phase 4 doesn't have a central figure that anchor to hold down the fort Tony Stark's presence almost guaranteed a baseline of quality something comfortable something to look forward to without that Cornerstone the MCU has felt more than a little derailed more than a little directionless without Tony to put it gently Captain America might have been the leader of the Avengers but Iron Man was their Foundation as well as the foundation for the entire MCU can anyone name a current character like that right now absolutely [ __ ] not an even bigger question might be is it possible to replace that kind of presence consider this through three phases of the MCU spanning 11 years Iron Man was in 10 out of 23 movies and he was on screen for 8 out of 11 of those years that included appearing on screen in 7 out of eight years from 2012 to 2019 and five straight years from 2015 to 2019. that's not just [ __ ] crazy that is what you call the backbone of the MCU even though Captain America is my favorite MCU character I'll be the first to admit that he only came into his own because of his cool calm and respectful personality being a contrast to Iron Man's unpredictable and often disrespectful one [Applause] then rule Asgard yes of course I will be reinstituting Prima nocta Iron Man Works without cap and while cap had one of the best movies in the MCU with Winter Soldier the character of Steve Rogers really found his footing as co-lead in the MCU after the events of Civil War when the tension between Steve and Tony reached his Apex and that the why we fight so we can end the fight so we get to go home I just did you know I'd argue it was Steve's relationship with Tony that brought out the best in this iteration of the character so if Iron Man brought out the best in his co-lead what do you think he did with the other characters in the MCU well he certainly helped us get through some of the Duds in the ever expanding Universe if it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't have been so forgiving with some of the shittier mid as [ __ ] to absolutely abysmal movies that came out with my Nostalgia glasses removed I think it's safe to say Ant-Man was an inconsequential film at best not the character but certainly both of his movies I wouldn't call them MCU highlights by any stretch Thor the Dark World enough said there Captain Marvel would Brie Larson work out like hypothetically would I at some point is that like a personal attack or something and speaking of Duds since the start of phase four what else do we have besides those MCU properties have ranged from mid to complete dog dookie besides Spider-Man even though it's apparently trendy to hate on that movie now but you won't see me following that one that movie [ __ ] owns and if you want to make something of it come to Indigo Plateau for a Pokemon battle we'll sort it out Charizard to Blastoise like real men we've had failures of new properties and wheel spinning sequels to popular leftovers from previous phases that have denigrated some of our favorite Heroes leading to a universe that's completely disjointed mix all that with complete over saturation and you have one hell of a mid product compared to what it used to be have they announced their plan for phase five and six yeah kind of certainly seemed a little more like pressing a panic button since even the most Ardent MCU stand can squeeze out in admittance that Marvel has been middle of the road for the past couple years at the very least a typical argument I've seen is that this is what happened in phase one Heroes going through their own stories and then coming together first of all uh no the plans were set for the first Avengers movie from the onset Marvel had planned for five movies with Iron Man being the first and after its success in May 2008 they announced the release date for The Avengers as summer 2011. although it did end up being released in 2012. at the time there wasn't a giant overarching story no but the Avengers was the first Direction phase 4 doesn't even have that there is no team there is no pattern it's following it's nothing like Phase One The Narrative was and still is correct it's directionless and without a backbone character like Iron Man to lead us through the bog of [ __ ] we find ourselves in and Deliver us to the promised land we're kind of hanging out on the Titanic right now even with Secret Wars as the destination who's bringing us there after end game there was a lot of excited speculation from who would be the new lead of the MCU and I include myself in this but I think I was a bit blind to the fact that there really wasn't anyone who could possibly take Tony's Place let's see who do we have Captain Marvel black panther no he would have been a great co-lead to the MCU much closer to a Captain America replacement in spirit more of the quiet reserved badass who'd still need that charismatic counterpart what about Spider-Man please while I love the character and really enjoy what Tom Holland's doing Marvel would never make a character the figurehead of the MCU whose movie rights are owned by another studio so we're [ __ ] out of luck there how about Doctor Strange cumberbatch's Doctor Strange is just as much of a wise ass as Downey Jr's Tony Stark it's why they were paired up in Infinity War because they played well off each other what is your job exactly besides making balloon animals protecting your reality douchebag but we all know what they've been doing to him he's used as a connecting piece in a plot mover but making him a side character in his own movie and look how they mess with my boy and as far as everyone else who the [ __ ] cares about him there's a reason b list versions of Legacy characters came in after if they were as interesting as The Originals they wouldn't be second in line there's no other way to put it black Widow 2.0 isn't as cool as black Oda one these characters are [ __ ] second no third string quarterbacks so anyway I'm not here to Fan cast future characters I don't particularly enjoy that sort of thing but we can definitely take a look at what characters are potential Replacements how about Reed Richards even if you got John Krasinski as the main MCU read I think I summed up my thoughts concerning his take on the character with he plays Reed as John Krasinski super nice person that's about it next what about Wolverine we know the character himself is Iconic and already has a legendary film portrayal excuse me I'm Eric lyncher tells Xavier go [ __ ] yourself thank you Hugh Jackman Lord I know everyone's complained that there was too much Wolverine in Fox's X-Men movies but there's a reason he got his own Trilogy he's that [ __ ] popular Jackman played the character that [ __ ] good and you're full of [ __ ] if you don't have a small Ember of Hope and excitement still burning about the potential for Wolverine in the MCU but with their current agenda Marvel seems like they'd rather eat [ __ ] straight from a butthole than make him a focal point you know maybe it ends up being a villain maybe Dr Doom is what does it maybe Doom is who the MCU gets centered around the character certainly offers plenty for an actor to do even with a mask there are plenty of people in Hollywood who could kill this role it would even allow the MCU to keep [ __ ] around with what the Drinker calls the message maybe then they could actually worry about writing a good story instead of just checking boxes regardless of whether or not they find the next Robert Downey Jr Tony Stark actor character combo to lead the MCU phase four is a straight up [ __ ] dud we got some mid we got some great but we got mostly cringe the MCU went from trailblazing Cinema architect crafting the next generation of easily digestible Blockbuster entertainment but like most things it's not immune to the decay of time decay of interest from fans decay of

#unity #gamedev",all hell has broken loose so let me get you up to speed with the timeline of the key things that have happened September 12th Unity made their initial announcement changing the whole business model effectively chaos ensued immediately September 13th and 14th Unity followed up with some clarification posts which were intended to put out the Flames but actually ended up stoking the fire even further because it basically clarified what people's worst suspicions were about the initial announcement things got much much worse an army of some of the biggest and most well-known game developers in the scene have come together in rebellion and protest of these changes many took to Twitter and social media with public statements voicing their opposition to these changes canceling future Unity projects canceling Partnerships and many even boycotting the platform outright Mega crit the makers of slay the spire and even Kenny the creator of the famous Kenny assets used in basically every Unity tutorial and so so many more Gary Newman the creator of the super hit Gary's Mod wrote a brilliant Manifesto aptly titled Unity can get [ __ ] you can find that on his Twitter some Cheeky Monkey even edited the Wikipedia page for greed adding John ricatello's photo as an example of what greed looks like and the memes just kept getting memeier so many memes uh most pretty light-hearted and playful my own um video I posted to Twitter three second video of me slapping the unity logo got 200 000 views which is funny because I intentionally put no hashtags or anything just to kind of keep it within my community but you know that's how it goes Unity stock prices took a bit of a dive and are now in a bit of a downward Trend so we'll see how that plays out and unity CEO John riccatello's personal Twitter got absolutely decimated by just like a stream of wild emotional tirades some pretty wild stuff I have to admit John rickettello I suck your ass yeah and then Unity closed its San Francisco office as a precaution due to threats the police got involved the FBI allegedly got involved and I believe it was later found that the threat came from our staff member at Unity it's all crazy absolutely crazy all of this it's gone so far and there are a lot of unity staff who are innocent bystanders in all of this that are probably copying some Flack because the Gaming Community has now got involved as well and Gamers don't give the [ __ ] they all just blast anyone I really feel for those people at Unity right now and and many Unity employees have spoken out about this and showing their discontent about the situation staff member jono Forbes wrote on Twitter as a Unity employee until this morning I assure you we fought like hell against this brought up all points everyone has we're told answers were coming and then the announcement went out without warning those of us who care are out more resignations coming end of this week so you can just imagine the turmoil going on in unity HQ right now obviously there is a divide between the people who just work there want to make good engines and good content for the community and you know upper management so what else people started digging around and discovered that Unity had changed the terms and conditions on their git repo in relationship to their contractual obligations with their engines now this is very dubious and suspicious if true and it's a bit of a cause for alarm because it could even be illegal and many studios have started involving their legal teams at this point and many people have got responses from their lawyers claiming that this whole situation barely makes sense legally and probably is not legal how did this even happen we have 7 000 staff at Unity God knows how many lawyers working for that company how do you just push it push this out like this and this is has led to some conspiracy theories there's various posts on Reddit people speculating that this is all part of a plan to try to lure a company like apple into a buyout Apple now is entangled with unity as part of their Vision Pro you know apple is somewhat Reliant perhaps on Unity to make content for their headset so they can't afford to have Unity tanking I don't know how these things work but I imagine when it comes to corporate kind of biases or manner of shenanigans that that take place I can I can only imagine and then we had the ultimatum letter a large number of Major mobile developers came together with an ultimatum letter to Unity basically stating you need to change this and until you do we are pulling all our Unity ads out we are turning them off effectively so all these companies are compromising their own profits at the moment losing a lot of money and these companies have said they will not turn these ads back on until Unity reverts this so where are we now well Unity has gone radio silent at this point after their last bungled um PR attempt they've kind of given up for the moment I think they need to think very carefully with what they write next because let me tell you like many of you who have their um ears on the ground right now who are in the think of it and understand that true nature of the situation a lot of people don't quite get it they're kind of just watching from afar I'm a developer I'm part of the scene I'm deep in it in the trenches I understand what's going on I've been spoken to hundreds of game developers over the past few days I've barely got in any sleep so let me tell you what's going on this is a very bad situation and I'm not sure Unity is taking it as seriously as it should be taken you know they followed up with a couple of response posts that were ambiguous full of corporate speak and just infuriated people further and further I just don't understand how this is possible with such a big sophisticated company a publicly traded company just shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over again trust is eroded to the point of breaking and I've had some people in my comments in the last video Try To Be Clever and say things like oh look This only affects people making more than you know 200k or whatever and but they are missing the whole point of this this is not about the 20 cents tariff that's only part of the much bigger problem here this is about a company rolling out what I've shown to be patently illogical and nonsensical business model changes out of nowhere with no warning basically [ __ ] on two decade-long relationships and Trust building and Goodwill from the community you know putting countless of businesses and livelihoods on The Chopping Block that's the problem and this affects everyone on the unity platform because it erodes the trust in the unity platform and it's affecting perception because here's the thing gamers are now paying attention to this I've been watching various gaming channels pick this up and talking about this and unity already has a negative reputation with some Gamers they just do now every time that splash screen fires up It's associated with this whole debacle you know the whole logo and branding is Tainted at this point trust is the glue that keeps Society together you break that trust and it's very hard slash impossible to get it back so that puts us in a very awkward position it's just not looking good you know so many people have already emotionally moved on a lot of Studios already making transition plans and porting plans to other platforms because they know they just cannot trust Unity simple as that they cannot put their livelihood under a dark cloud and forever Wonder this is going to happen again the bus is moving and unity is silent and like many I have a unity game currently in the works that I can't just you know Port over to another engine it will just add another another year or something to my you know timeline and that's just not acceptable at this point so I have to continue with unity and it's hard you know it because I'm kind of at the point right now at least in this current climate where I just don't even want to see the unity logo I don't even want to fire up the IDE I'm just I need to distance myself and take a break with the exception of making this video of course and I think the true damage will be done when the next Dev cycle is finished when current games go out and Studios have to then start their new projects and have to decide which platform are they going to use Unity Godot unreal or other and I think that's when the true damage will be revealed because those platforms like Godot are stepping up at a time like this this the creator of Godot oh my God what a guy he has been up this whole time just trying to um help Shepherd all the unity refugees but he's not pushing them he's telling them to look be cautious don't be impulsive think very carefully through your decision but if you choose Godot this is what will do for you and he's gone as far as making a road map plan for the ex Unity developers he's talking about adding an asset store he's talking about adding more robust integrated C sharp support I mean so where do I stand on all of this myself now I mentioned kind of my position in the last video but I'll say it again just so we clear you know I am a Unity user I don't want to see you need to go down it's not going to benefit me and as developers it's in our best interest to have more game engines than less because competition is what's going to bring out the best in these engines for us but I understand there are some people who at this point are so insulted with unity where they're patronizing corporate speak and just the audacity of this whole situation that they just want to see Unity burn I I don't blame them you know but but just know it doesn't benefit anyone if Unity Goes Up in Flames you know I was there for the fall of flash I worked through it and for those who were part of that will know how huge and traumatic that was Flash I know it's been a while now it's been over 10 years but that was a huge platform every single advertising company was using this this was the biggest plug-in in the world I think like 99.9 of computers had this flash plugin installed it was a big deal so when this thing went away it was just a just a void in the market and we all scattered and many of us went to Unity I did and it's funny to think that a decade later here I am back again in the bus to hell I'm not sure some people realize how fast these situations can change I've heard some people say well Unity is a multi-billion dollar company it's something it's gonna die and to that I'll say you weren't there for the flash thing and you weren't there maybe for angularjs hell the biggest web making platform and framework in the world at one point basically went away in a week because of some changes and everyone went over to react this happens trust me developers are a Fickle Bunch we do not mess about when it comes to our livelihood and if something is threatening it we shift we pivot very very quickly it happens very fast so believe me when I say you can be a juggernaut company and it can all go away very quickly believe it once something is looked down on in the tech space when something is effectively not cool man it's kind of over you know and is this kind of where we are heading right now with unity because it's not the first uh event this has been various things that have been happening over the past few years and this is kind of like the nail in the coffin it's like the final the final blowing it's like henshiro from the Fist of the North Star says you know you're dead you just don't know it yet perception trust is everything so where does unity even go from here I mean it'll be it's going to be so interesting to see what they come back with really because at this point as far as I can see they would have to firstly walk the whole thing back the whole thing absolutely all of them then they would probably have to you know change the whole management of that company and then they would have to like offer some some Goodwill concessions I don't know they'd have to like send a pen to all the developers or something but even then I just don't know if there's coming oh man it's how do you come back from this so what's next for me well funnily enough I had a plan prior to this of getting back to making Unity tutorials and educational content I had a udemy course in the works that I'd spent about four months preparing already so all this stuff is pretty much dead and that's a big part of this larger problem that Unity has what makes Unity popular as a platform apart from its engine is the community all the videos all the learning resources and udemy course and various things that people make for free can you imagine at this point after the situation anyone going and making a Unity tutorial on YouTube as someone who has made tutorials in the past that notion to me is absolutely light off the table I mean why would I I might as well just spend the time on you know making Godot tutorials at this point once that Lake dries up all those learning resources as newer versions of unity potentially come out you've lost a big chunk of the value that was the unity platform so anyways guys look after yourselves and I've been just scrolling Twitter at this point and my eyes need a break let's see what happens guys and we'll uh we'll talk soon

0:23-1:27: Episode 7 Review
1:27-5:24: Episode 8 Review
5:24-9:02: FANS HATE THE GHOSTING",so it looks like the latest episode of jjk is causing quite an uproar on social media [Music] yo what's good as a boy to the Views and happy spoilers for jjk episode 7 and 8 you have been warned before we dive into the backlash that happened online I'll just give my overall thoughts and opinions onto last week's episode that I missed out I really like the colors in the fight with mojito I really like the design of muta's robot like suit it reminded me of some of those Mech suits from Evangelion and it just reminded me of a lot of older Mech anime fight scenes I really liked how creepy the scene in Tokyo was when the veil covered up all the civilians enjoying their Halloween party and then they were all being blown away it made me feel really uneasy watching it I like seeing the matrio or split up and all in different groups I'm guessing this is setting us up for the events of the Shibuya incident that's gonna happen I like a nabara and Marky are teamed up together and there was this little moment with nabara picking something out of Marquis shirt I don't know if she was trying to wipe dirt off a jacket or something but just little small moments like that made me realize how much nobara adores Marky and she looks up to her does she see her like some sort of older sister or is there more than meets the eye if you know what I mean as we go into the next episode I love Gojo in some of the scenes of him just walking over people he's such a Prat but you just love to see it I like the Final Act of the episode where goja confronts the main villains in the subway there's a flashback scene where you see Gator on the other villain in a playground talking about their evil schemes and trapping Gojo and the entire scene is in a playground now while they are there just watching over my hito just playing around like a child because we all know that mojito inside is little kid I feel like this scene had a double meaning we all know that playgrounds are for children and children are innocent and pure and oblivious to their surroundings and what they're doing or thinking in a way it kind of correlates to the villains they don't see anything wrong with what they are doing in in their eyes they're the innocent ones they're the ones doing what feels right hand they're oblivious to the chaos and destruction that they are causing but dude did he have to hang out in the playground it's super creepy but trapping Gojo down in the subway with all the civilians so he can't fully utilize his special technique it was a pretty dirty move on the villain's part honestly it's been some time since I last watched season one so you honestly forget how Despicable these guys are with jogo just murdering some innocent civilians there was one shot of Gojo with his eyes just looking down at Jugo and he tells Jugo that he shot at first that's the audience we think that he shot that Jugo murdered the civilians but in reality he shouts because juga thinks he can defeat him just adding to the arrogance and Cockiness and how much of a pratt Gojo is in this moment but honestly you'd love to see it even though Gojo is on the side of humanity and in a way he is seen as a hero there are moments where I do question Gojo's mindset what I mean by that is goja could have been a bit surprised or saddened that Jugo was just murdering innocent civilians but he just smiles and he just tells Jugo can you defeat me like he doesn't seem to care too much about what these cursed Spirits are doing to these civilians as long as he can take him down that's all that matters I know Gojo does have a heart and He does care but there are just certain moments where he can act too much like a Prat and be a bit big-headed and cocky but I suppose that is all part of Gojo's character and who he is on the outside he's shown to be this lovable fool but when things get serious and business needs to be taken care of then fun and games go out the window and he's super serious and it's a bit scary sometimes but it is what it is Gojo has to do what needs to be done he has to be the one to do the dirty work I mean he is definitely one of the most powerful Jiu Jitsu sorceress so a lot of people are counting on him so sometimes this boy needs to get his hands dirty to achieve what he needs to do it's very interesting in the story but with all the praise out of the way let's talk about the negative and the things I didn't quite like about this episode I didn't like the first scene with meimei and her little brother at first I thought this was her child but then it was revealed to be her little brother their whole dynamic is just weird I don't like it not a fan of it I think it's mainly the little brother he sort of represents that typical Anime boy character who's either a super simp for a girl or is very protective over a lady and any man that gets in his way of that lady he just acts really aggressive and angry just that weird relationship he has with her it's just a bit yucky but it is Anime it is what it is he sort of reminded me of yushiro from Demon Slayer and I wasn't quite a huge fan of the itadori and grasshopper curse Spirits fight I just felt like the entire grasshopper character felt like some sort of filler character the whole fight was pretty damn Goofy and silly especially how this episode sets us up for what is potentially going to be a pretty dark Arc I know the show needs some comedy but this felt a little bit too much and I wasn't a fan of the writing in this moment the animation didn't really bother me it was just the whole writing and the grasshopper character but those are my thoughts of the episodes but in terms of the animation I thought the art and animation looked pretty good not the best but not the worst but there is a lot of people online who absolutely hate this episode for one reason and one reason only the ghosting effect it was really apparent in the itadori and grasshopper Spirit fight what it looks like where when they are clashing with one another it looks like the frame dims to a lower brightness and the in-betweens almost have a fuzziness or a blur filter over it so it doesn't look too sporadic and flickery I think this is due to the fact that back in the 90s there was that one episode of Pokemon where some kids got an epileptic seizure watching the episode they called it Pokemon shark so ever since then whenever there is a sequence of Animation where characters are clashing and fighting there's a lot of bright colors they tend to dim down the actual sequence I noticed this a lot in the earlier seasons of my hero with all might's fight sequences I don't think it means to look bad I feel like it helps it doesn't hurt my eyes but for some people they do find this to be a bit of above her so let's see some of the negative responses towards this episode what is the dimming and ghosting is even worse than last episode looks like a video game that looks so awesome maybe they are just saving the budget for the later parts of Shibuya what is going on at mapa Brad the first season looked alright toei animation eye episode ghosting aside it feels like such an awkward pacing at least this is a low priority episode slash moment but two episodes in a row is wild animation is mediocre enough the ghosting just adds salt to the wound all I'm saying season 1 animation was better season one would never make this Abomination they called me a Madman when I said the quality of production during hidden inventory looked compared to season one now look how far Fallen they're really fun with a bag when season one director left his fight scenes are Next Level every fight from season one where top tier weakest episode of the season and understandably so the content is not the best diver timing in the comedic scenes where are for weak storyboards limited animation ghost and Demon makes it even worse but next week will be a big one ghosting in season 2 has absolutely been Dreadful so far you can't even tell what's happening sometimes today's jjk episode wasn't good grasshopper curse fight was poorly edited and storyboard and the dimming and ghosting didn't help either the stuff at the end with Gojo looked good but it wasn't enough to save it jjk more like Danny Phantom with all that ghosting am I right guys people literally pay to watch this and yet it's unwatchable we are in for a long season please do something about the ghosting and dimming definitely the worst episode of jjk so far it's really just been met with some good Cuts here and there storyboard is basic action especially suffers clearly low priority and next episode should be good also screw the ghosting what's gonna start season two today but what on Earth is this just stick to one piece never in a hundred years I'd have fought my Shibuya anime experience would be ruined by Crunchyroll lazy a not negotiating getting the original non-ghosting and undimmed version from toei since the JP lore doesn't apply to streaming services at all so yes it looks like a lot of people aren't too happy with the ghosting and dimming effect in this episode but like I said before I think it's necessary to have that effect also I don't think the animation was as intense as how some of the earlier fights from the season looked because as some people had mentioned it's a low priority episode and I think they're saving their budget for the next episodes coming in the future so I think people need to just sort of take a chill pill and stop stressing out about this but I do beg fans not to send any death threats or hate towards the animators at tamarpa or Crunchyroll it just feels like entitlement to the highest degree let's just hope that next week's episode is going to look pretty damn amazing tell me the comments down below what you guys thought of this episode do you like the episode are dropping the bag with the animation I thought it looked pretty good like this video subscribe for more anime reactions reviews comparison to breakdown's rankings and more but thank you for watching and as always I already review something

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",these new character posters for Ahsoka are so good and give us for the first time ever a high-res look at Captain Rex in live action it's so cool seeing the detail in his armor like for example the etchings on his arm guards and I honestly can't believe this has been such a long time waiting seeing Captain Rex in live action we also got a look at Padawan Ahsoka which more clearly shows her holding her prequel era green lightsaber along with adorning her Padawan headwear Anakin's Clone Wars armor in live action is also just something else I saw some people saying that Hayden christensen's shoulders aren't wide enough for this armor and then he looks much more impressive in the Clone Wars version that's nonsense he looks epic look at him with the short hair how can you not get enough of this something I think we never thought we'd see in Star Wars

all right let's be objective here remove emotion yes let's judge this movie on its merits yes oh my gosh starting on Gwen this time with the score being drums because she's a drummer and also this entire intro is just her drum solo and inner monologue and this is her story even though she's talking about miles giving us a new perspective on the first movie and it starts out slow and builds to this incessant Pace that puts you on edge in a way that you'd never expect from the first three minutes but the story goes there and she's letting us know right up front perfect objectivity he was bitten by a radioactive spider and he's not the only one also not the only one is the polar opposite of the openings the first film that was all about the one and only Spider-Man the one and only Spider-Man also letting us View events we've already seen reinterpreted through Gwen's Universe Earth 65 that has a much more abstract and emotionally driven Style with smudged pastels that honestly when I saw an into the spider-verse my first thought was boy I hope we don't spend a lot of time here it hurts my brain and dang it was I wrong to have that fear because it's dope and can convey things that the more realistic or let's say beholden to our version of reality type worlds can't and yeah I totally skipped over the reoccurring 42s in the first movie because I noticed them but it just didn't seem important oh you sweet summer child you I won't do that this time I didn't want to hurt him but I did and the timeline is wonky right now because it's what the movie is about sure plenty of movies jump to the end of the prologue we're listening to Gwen discuss A disruption in the Canon or maybe she's just recounting the cannon who could say yes leopard's drummer Rick Allen famously lost an arm in a car accident but overcame what seemed like insurmountable odds especially in 1984 to not only continue as the drummer but do it during arguably their most successful era anyway not sure what overcoming absurda has to do with this film and you don't want to talk I didn't join a band so I could talk about my feelings well honesty you gotta find those connections where you can Betty I play Adult Rec Soccer to see my brothers more we do what we can you always wind up with solo act [Music] so much music in this one to talk about like so many songs of note which is crazy because the first movie also had a killer soundtrack and score and I think by bringing in Metro Boomin they outdid themselves self-love captures the mood did gwenko as VLC Player for Halloween Dead costume also peed in his lizard self whatever each frame also reinforces that even Gwen's hair color changes depending on the moods or Seasons or Vibes plus it's that something something took a picture every day for 10 years and now I'm a hottie but clearly slipped into depression as the crushing weight of adulthood came down on me you know what [Music] there's a very monitor lizard design for this version of the lizard that makes him less sympathetic than others making the Switchback to Peter even more jarring for us and Gwen wanted to be special like you when but getting Huey to be the saddest and most pitiable Peter Parker was an inspired choice no offense Jack George JK Simmons is going to be playing Jay Jonah from his deathbed and JK Simmons is always a win does does that Banner just say social media classic want it to give your old man up [Music] foreign [Music] if there was any confusion about what the colors in Earth 65 mean this should clear it up the Warm Glow bleeds out from their hug even her hair turns from green back to blonde and we get the first notes of her Spider Woman theme I'm not totally sure I'd like having people see what my mood ring says at all times but I guess he used to it it would make deciphering crushes and also coming clean about crushes a lot easier what color aura is that Middle School feel you know never mind also she moves so fast that she leaves the comic frame before it can disappear and then when her dad is called to a superhuman event her hair turns back to green and her skin gets an even darker blue as he leaves spider Gwen has her radio inside a penguin oh yeah it does say social media also protect trans kids good Ally Gwen foreign have I mentioned that Gwen's Spider-Woman theme is my new absolute favorite theme and I don't think I've ever truly liked a motif before I heard this one I mean yeah it was cool how's the Manhunt for me going good to know and I kind of love that both Gwen and Miles thank you for your bravery tonight and live action Holland Man actually all do their interpretation of tough guy New Yorker to cover their voices why are you narrating that voice because it's fun by the way amazing design for the de vulture get it it's like Da Vinci but it's the vulture we have fun here and obviously you're not watching this without having seen into the spider-verse but in case you are Gwen showcases her skill set and the way she Heroes inside 40 seconds webbing up people in the background utilizing her ballet skills and being nonchalant about arrows flying at her cuz spidey sense [Music] don't tell yourself short this movie is art oh Jeff Coons his stuff is Art too parchment paper subtitles Miguel's theme is also sick but he knows it's sick if you get my drift which is wiper for Gwen's still dope also he has claws and a retractable Cape so he's not left wanting to be cool although I'm starting to see why he and Peter don't get along that well take that off it's disrespectful Spider-Man doesn't wear a cake now that's a Multiverse movie I need to see okay knock yourself out why are you saying it like that she got him so good her theme kicks back in are you guys talking about none of yourself just in case vulture didn't get it don't even get me started on Doctor Strange with a little nerd back on Earth 1999.99 that's fair they were idiots about it the thing my brain kept doing in theaters both times actually was thinking haha the references and dialogue are so funny oh holy crap I forgot this is also an awesome action movie with a crap ton of new spite he's doing Spidey stuff no joke happened a bunch okay [Music] who's Ed education department I feel like I should know bags of holding are dope though especially when they're named for something applicable to spider ham it'll fit in your pocket oh it's editorial it's been a long time I know I asked for an Andrew Garfield Spidey film with Jessica Drew as his mentee and I stand by that request this is also pretty good Spider Woman me too although that said I will gladly take a live-action Jessica Drew Spider Woman film starring Issa Rae honestly I pretty much back anything starring Issa Rae my husband wants it to be a surprise he's really corny but so hot priorities is it because she calls you dark Garfield no do you say anything but no no yes ah she Bugs Bunny Dem love that seeing the vibrant colorful city is too much for him and we see it reflected in his eyes as well as visuals for the sounds coming from the city Clairvoyance good stuff a visual handoff inside a split second don't understand the way the colors shatter invert and overexpose extremely accurate representation of what a father and daughter would feel in a situation like this and her colors are now bleeding down as everything starts falling apart I could definitely see this as a little nod to Gwen coming out in allegory for lgbtq plus peeps she also just happens to use the trans colors for her suit but the timing of it feels deliberate behind Gwen is her mask and her dad is seeing her face and her mask at the same time and the mask is 10 times bigger than her she can't hide it anymore and she feels exposed and if Mulan is to be trusted mirrors are important to folks when they're trying to share their identity but unlike earlier she can't hide this time I also think it's totally open to interpretation not everything needs to be spelled out for it to work for you and speaking of everyone knowing what you're feeling and potentially being able to infer what you're thinking that's some pretty icy blue he's got there Gwen it's a good thing this entire movie doesn't take place in Earth 65 because I'm not sure I'd be able to help myself the explosion of magenta and pink coming out of Gwen is she's pleading and reaching for her dad's acceptance please and I even feel like that's evidence that people are reading the colors and the Blackness inking in freaked him out just like we often misinterpret each other's emotions and motives even without Billboards displaying them brutally delivered line join the club ah it's a double entender this Miguel guy has already grown on me yeah leaving your dad Universe behind would leave you feeling a little blue the Red X not allowed to connect the E and the X because of trademark infringement you've seen the air before right please just let me Rob you I love that spot has definitely thought this out but doesn't lead with the right information it takes him almost a full minute to get to the reason he's saying let me Rob you I'm not even robbing you I mean this hm machine doesn't even belong to you right this belongs to the bank I was actually considered handsome by scientists it depends who you ask Rushmore days go on it's got Pilgrim days also go on asteroid City days still going on so yeah yeah he's attractive he uses the Cancer all the atmo and from your past one year ago oh come on and Jason can turn it all from a joke to something sinister with a quick tone change I was bitten by a radioactive spider that is not how I remember him but I love the artistic license taken to make spider 42 cuter might do the same I love that he's drawing all his buddies in art class has proportions work their sizes vary even a quick flip on his Pages LeapFrog Grizzly some guy in purple he's been heroined it up without us endorse baby powder apologize for endorsing baby powder made a mistake dang good on him for writing that wrong even if Peter B recommended it bad for babies lungs [Music] that would be really nice but it's almost as likely as them throwing the couch into another dimension like that good analogy Spidey and I wasn't dwelling when I wrote Colleen's name over and over my notebook in fourth grade oh no I've already talked about this this makes it even weirder good thing she doesn't watch YouTube got him come on see exactly what you're doing and so did I I knew it said no expectations I did I swear I just wanted to see if you'd catch it gosh it's too tight in the back by the way helpfulness I'm not your guy in the chair oh Genki got shredded too I don't care don't you dare slander Ned and you don't want to be the guy in the chair but you're playing Spider-Man are those my Jordans I can't help it if we're the same size nah I'm not even a sneaker head but I know if you casually wear someone else's Jordan Ones without asking that's pretty much grounds to have your clothes folded while you're still in them not to mention they're Spider-Man's Jordan Ones and my job is to capture your person's Universe on this piece of paper good luck miles has two can't have your cake and eat it unless you bake two cakes dang that's like the the thing you can't do that in life both of them get a response just with the looks and movements they give I think that's how you know if you've done well as a parent now be in Spanish what oh okay but the Puerto Rican flag snap Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country dimensional threshold oh man that's real support right there you don't have to know what's going on but you catch a word here and there and you pump up your kid travel to other dimensions yeah okay oh yeah that sounds like a really good fake job I mean Pump him up but don't miss a chance to dunk either wait you were born plus your mom used to well now I definitely need to know what his mom used to look life is a journey Brian diary Henry has always been funny but I feel like he must have been held back in the first movie because now he's stealing scenes and Genki was barefoot in his kicks yikes bro I'm never gonna pass up an opportunity to mention Tottenham Hotspur in a video because it's one of those made up sounding Premier League names oh right the guy in the poster is their Captain also he's one of three South Korean Men playing in the Premier League so absolutely worthy of a poster on genki's ball he's barely a villain of the Witch had to go and say that like father like son I'll always applaud the sensible choice I did that once it's so satisfying I mean I was on a ladder or anything but I did feel like Spider-Man for a few minutes while pooping later we learned that all spideys go through the same stuff because of Canon events and that makes a simple little jump and spin between the three portals even cooler than just a reference to Toby man jumping between goblins blade bomb things the black and white pen drawing style art here is amazing just another insanely skilled artist adding to this masterpiece okay so this is interesting and if it's true makes what Miguel says later wrong because that's miles 42 about to be bitten which makes mile 1610 not an anomaly at all I mean the mere existence of Miles Prowler also kind of proves that but we're not there yet you hit me with a bagel that guy does kind of look like Jason Schwartzman and obviously I knew onomatopoeia Bagel guy was going to be important you did this to me I love the hints of his voice going full Evil Nemesis even if we're not quite ready for that yet either oh this is why nobody likes us man it's really not but I appreciate the movie at least trying to acknowledge reality every once in a while hey Gutierrez you canceled a crane oh no look realization many of your generation ignore their mental health too long this isn't just funny it's also something that miles would probably love to say to his dad but never would now those are Ben day dots all a uniform size not like the halftones in Miles Earth 1610. my holes can take me anywhere that's what's so fun about holes explore the holes splitting the fabric of space and time for you it's just a Tuesday night to be fair Mrs Chen has seen it all I kind of want to see the argument between Eddie and Venom Over The Branding of the gum because you know Venom wouldn't be cool with green packaging my holes aren't a curse and let's all be so lucky to feel that way about holes can you stop talking about your holes get everyone uncomfortable over you might even have some anti-holes guys can't handle it so in into the spider-verse miles was animated on twos or 12 frames per second until his leap of faith where he was on ones or 24 frames per second the thing people seem to miss is that when he's not spideying he's back on twos everyone is though unless they're thipping but my point here is that Lego Peter is on two's ish but his legs aren't like fours and fives sometimes I'm assuming to draw a further delineation from the rest of the real world and the letters have flipped fall to the ground because there ain't no flipping if your hands are full unless you have bungees and aren't worried about your pizzas getting a little smushed oh hey but also he did the thing two cakes unless you bake two cakes starting to see the Genki is Right stretch too thin all right thanks for the tip and I'm with the inspiring moments he switches between 24 and 12 frames per second depending on how fluid the movement needs to be in the 42nd minute and the 42nd second of the movie miles is wearing his 42 jerseys see I told you I wouldn't slouch classic encouragement message I'd studied for eight months nine it was I give a birth no it wasn't of course not me he gets points with a quick correction though he's a little Double Take how do they get over there so fast waiter they Spider-Man away no I'm Spider-Man right I have no idea deal what's going on with you so why don't you tell me the DJ is trying so hard this moment is easy to miss because Gwen shows up in a few seconds but dang it if that isn't Young Love encapsulated in one visual being grounded is prison to us as teens but sometimes all it takes is a brief reminder that they are out there to put a stupid smile on our stupid faces and I don't love hummingbird as much as sunflower right away which makes me think I may like it more in the long run it's a solid track though miles is living the dream all team boys wish for is our crushes to fall through portals into our nevermind hugging is that Katie's moose spin you Thief many too honestly best response she could give kills the tension clarifies absolutely nothing it is Spider-Man grounded and Mr and Mrs Morales are right later she's a bad influence and what was true of the first movie is true of this one there's no motion blur so it doesn't matter where you paused you end up with an amazing piece of art that would look amazing on my wall speaking of killer is man no one my age says those words in that order loving the way the camera follows miles under and through obstacles does that mean you stay overnight or missing out on everything Vibe is cutting deep big wait is that everything everywhere all at once I bet 1610 is the universe with sexy Suave women so like how does Gwen stay stuck when all that's in contact with the building is her Chucks like the sticky spider barbs would be so far away right well that's the thing we've all been looking at Spidey stickiness wrong for a long time and it's probably raymie's fault there's a bit of this sure but also it's basically magic Spider-Man can change the laws of attraction between things at a molecular level part of the spider people's mutation is that they can effectively will things to stick together so that's how and thank goodness because this shot with the camera following Gwen around the ledge is absolutely stunning and pop money is another dimension what a track for this moment captures the Stillness at the top of the building for two people with confusing feelings for each other reveling in something they have in common separate from the rest of the well most of the world I know sometimes ranting about how beautiful the art is in this film is like ranting about how Sandy the beach is because it's kind of a given but this makes me want to be an artist and move to New York it's not even the real New York that's how beautiful it is in every other Universe Gwen Stacy Falls for Spider-Man and in every other Universe it doesn't end well my gut reaction in this moment is dang sorry miles been there and like me Lee wants them to be together because as we've established previously I'm romance pilled and I'm not sure Gwen doesn't have romantic feelings for Miles she smiles talking about Gwen and Spider-Man being together but my gut check is that it would have to suck for Gwen to come to the only person that really truly gets her and have to navigate his feelings at a time when she's just looking for a friend I guess it's just unfortunate that so many of us immediately associate emotional intimacy with romantic intimacy but also their teens and while this stuff is hard to get read as an adult it's a billion times harder as young adults it's but miles half shoots his shot and then backs off and Gwen doesn't give him false hope or get upset with him so kudos to both of them for paying attention to each other's cues did this need to be this long no but as previously mentioned I'm a romantic give this movie all of the awards I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish it's funny because he does and they didn't translate it for us and what he said was sarcastic in Spanish something like how awful Captain Morales ah Captain wow she is bad at this I think if I was a kid I'd think it was awesome but now I'm not a kid and dang that's a bad first impression Rio yeah I'm using my first name okay handshakes huh doesn't have the same oomph does it I love that in addition to the out of registration style they use to show things out of focus there's also blurry highlights and even just outlines to give the feeling of haze in front of buildings way off in the distance and what I worry about most is they will they won't look out for you like us wherever you go from here you have to promise to take care of that little boy for me this really loving and moving speech is even rougher when you realize that it's the last time mile sees his real mom for the rest of the movie never let anyone at those big fancy places he's gonna be in tell him that he doesn't belong there [Music] here crying someone else has no clue what's coming but it's exactly what his mom warns him about to a level that very few people have ever experienced [Music] swaely back with Metro Boomin to slip into our brains like the sweetest and gentlest earworm the beat and groove on annihilate that kicks in just as miles is leaving his mom again builds up what would otherwise be a typical moment of miles just going to see Gwen into what it actually is the end of miles's time in Earth 1610 and the beginning of miles's real journey we resip is genius and now I really feel bad for spot because he did have a beautiful beard frowny face that's a real scientist right there even the primarily holographic replay shows the dark matter for what it is I'll never see him again honestly I forgot about this line and it puts everything about this scene into a totally different light because there's no point in allowing yourself to fall for someone that you think you'll never see again yeah thank you thank you so much I promise you you're welcome shut up encouragement a nod to Remy's iconic Spider-Man kiss now with les Toby Maguire waterboarding there's just no way she doesn't sense him there right why else would she leave the portal open for him they usually close pretty quickly it was a year for portals to far away Lance Mario quantumania 65 Guardians 3 Meg 2 Barbie probably I can only listen to Indiana Jones at a portal through time portal gear I love the impression that my botan is built vertically with Bridges overlapping and it's always fun to see what other universes might have come up with [Music] score our perfection hey it's a chai Cafe wonder what they sell there hey another one hello pardon me locals wow four on there wow that's very dangerous little dialogue details that make the spider-verse movies engaging and relatable spot is the big bad but he's also still kind of a normal guy move over that's the best you can do what that was epic in the moment improv so that's tadak which seems to be Hindi for snapping or snap or crack and shout out to Hara boot that's Hindi for Green Goblin I'm what you'd call a student of the world and a schmuck you don't use any product at all just coconut oil prayer some genetics oh that one stings Pop I love chai tea what did you just say as a student of the world I would never make this mistake but I appreciate that they explain this for other people not me I mean it would be a little like not knowing that the m in ATM stands for machine and the n in pin stands for number ATM machine my PIN number also the way caught on Sony hits bro is both the sweetest and most condescending way I've ever heard the word said and details the T overflowing the fact that miles is still wearing Pav's Auntie's scarf by a vertical City would be the absolute best city for Spidey because of the swinging and this is where the British stole all of our stuff history lessons also things the British should correct lessons spot right in the Julia Roberts also fun fact Elizabeth Gilbert the author of epray Love had to cancel her sequel because it took place in Russia and maybe more like a mid fact spot is starting to remind me of Jumper and that at some point he won't really have to take steps anymore a problem for human Hayden Vader may be less so for holy cow man but I love how much more formidable spot is at this point using the holes to actually increase inertia and really give miles a run for his money some might say now you're thinking with portals what should I know about Kobe oh looks like he did not know sometimes you just need that friend around that says the things a new guy must be in love with you we got along great and we're close friends if you thought spider Punk felt extra glitchy it's cause he's on threes so his movements only happen every three frames and I like to think Hobie does it on purpose because Donald Duck the man use the poem not just your fingers and he's immediately helpful miles is understandably jealous but hoey's a good dude there's a scorpion reference and a Captain America reference in the same panel his entire city is one big anti-punk landscape that is when I'm not playing shows antagonizing fascists I love that there's this massively important thing going on with immense stakes and then they're also fighting spots can you see what I did there but seriously there's so much information being thrown around and the takeaway is who could blame anyone progression on Hobie he's definitely created to be an over-the-top stereotype and yet everything about him is still Pitch Perfect you're not a joke this year no one here thinks you're a joke subtle snip our future I'm gonna take everything from you the shift in the score and spots of voice are chilling and spot is now terrifying each of their eyes going wide in unison and they each get a stylized letter for the snap we'll clear the path you slow down that build I know we just had that other movie but usually Spider-Man doesn't get this level of teamwork and it is perfect the way he uses his Kata to save people yo-yoing them around classic Spider-Man misunderstanding of his own lore but it makes sense he's brand new six months sounds like the right amount of time for a life-altering Canon event it's been so easy for him he's the only one who didn't know better than to say this well the that was another easy adventure for Spider-Man [Music] also you can't can't have your cake and eat it too unless you bake two cakes you're amazing aha yeah she gets to use that word yeah whatever it's in the comic title but she also saying what she really feels and hearing that from your crush at this age might actually be enough to get you through how much of an optimism kill floor the rest of life can be don't let anyone tell you being a teen is easy and don't feel like there's something wrong with you if you don't identify with people insisting it's the best time of your life because it ain't that for everyone it's a metaphor for couples Hobie You're Gonna Lose Me Subs with that kind of talk loving the dad bod representation in this Spidey all spideys are beautiful how are you even cooler under your mask oh this is cool the whole time what a perfect response you could read it as yeah I'm cool but considering hobie's ethos throughout the film I take it as meaning that it's not being a superhero that makes Hobie cool Hobie is what makes Hobie cool might be a lesson in there upside down elevator is an elegant yet effective security measure to keep non-spidies out okay this would be a lot every Spidey competing for the best quip welcome spiders her usual eye boy trailers and if you did the same did you also audibly gasp even the car feeder's name is a bit hey in Lego Peter is Back Stereo wow stereo and spider ham don't face off in the third film then there's no hope for the world ah there he is a Prowler Prowler not your Prowler so poor Childish Gambino got zapped for the wrong Dimension from Earth 19999 when strange and Holland man did their Shenanigans the sheer number of earths they're signing here is making me feel very anxious for any writers who join this universe who will have to refer back to the universe Bible so as not to piss off the fans me piss off me sorry Spidey Vibes interesting Gwen interesting but I'm not like the others how are you gonna go off on Miles when you're also one of a kind oh right this is one of the most jarring sequences because the room is 24 frames per second on ones miles is at 12 frames per second on twos and Hobie is at eight frames per second on threes and yet it's still somehow all believable like it works because they're in spider Society why are you in a big pause though I really can't get over I hope he's looking out for him just don't do this till you know what will you fight rev thrown out solid life lessons can I say Prof man damn things either way solve life lessons I'm just gonna try and ignore you I can't even Gloria oh boy humble in reality Spider-Man has arrived boom roasted in it may day Mayday is a Jude win she's his favorite part of the movie he's right though everything she does is perfect to be funny the fate of the Multiverse you always lose me with that okay see hope he gets it hey you want to see pictures she's right here she's incredible yep Gwen's line is perfect also my friends without kids tell me this is exactly what it's like with other people I assume everyone always wants to see my kids taking a crap on the establishment even this tiny face keeping up the consistency of how timelines look since Loki it's called the arachno humanoid poly Multiverse which sounds stupid too I guess honestly you'd think the waterboarding would be under the bad stuff but how how are you not gonna have Topher in the oh wait Toby is right there my bad that's how the story is supposed to come all the stock of Canon events really clarifies the intro to enter the spider verse because everything was just slightly different than we'd seen before but we now know that this is necessary for every Spider-Man and all I can say is thank you Remy that's why Gwen tried to stop you I thought you were trying to save me I was doing both oh you can't can't have your cake unless you bake two cake always making flashbacks clear with even another new more simplistic animation style that's smiling to Furious match cut isn't that right Peter humbling reality Spider-Man I mean Peter was involved just makes everything sadder the way more and more spider people keep walking in to circle around miles as if they can all sense what's about to happen even if Miguel didn't tell them saving an entire world everywhere I can do both I mean I almost believe it with miles but you can't okay two cakes we know it's hard but it's the truth miles even the CW slash Disney xd's Spectacular Spider-Man you know it's serious when the other animated Spider-Man gets involved kid look up calling me here we go hot dang Hobie is a real G I love that he's been watching this whole time without saying much just waiting for his moment and supports miles like no one else does okay you're gonna help me it's never not cool biggest pointing meme ever it's dead now I think we killed it are you going to mix tension and humor so well oh you have my Creator voice on my face what's the deal here at Wallace now if that's all we get of spider cat I'll be bummed but I appreciate the time y'all had together how is T-Rex fighting off Jude's favorite I don't know she was runner-up cute wins over awesome I guess but for me T-rex Spider-Man spider Rex finally an MJ Spiderwoman I get that like you need to be a certain way to get accepted into spider society and so maybe Tom Holland Spider-Man wouldn't anyway because don't you get the feeling he'd be helping miles rather than chasing him he's learning from Hobie not playing by their rules little moments like this show how far out the sequence was it's not needed per se but it's so good and once again adds humor despite the tension they're always building character I can do anything he can oh okay so sometimes the number of frames you can move within a second does matter she was practicing for the classic trying very hard to pull two heavy things together can an event my bad everybody there was somewhere to run Metro Boomin just out here living the dream getting his own Spider-Man variant but honestly after that 2017 mixtape with Gucci Mane he deserves it way to finesse the plug Metro pretty sure I'm using that right I've got you trapped in my well-defined musculature I know I should be happy with that Scarlet Spider is Andy Sandberg and I am but really I'm just stoked to see one of Jude's action figures come to life one squeeze and then we'll talk because I think it's going to change our box oh it's very rejuvenating it is even a her spittleward animations are cute solid real real heartfelt ones [Music] but realism it definitely doesn't come natural to everyone and again they're all spider people so they just can't stop quipping no matter how high the octane it's so perfect anyone else getting flashbacks of Professor ratigan climbing Big Ben nothing gives kids nightmares like kids cartoons anyway it works I assume Jude will be saying something similar about Miguel in 10 years you know anomaly this is a mind blower are you telling me that Miguel came back from 2099 specifically four miles he trains in the score here are torturous also projection much miles it's four-year-old good who decides that fair point sounds like a whole big question I did were hundreds of spider people away from your own Clubhouse I guess he did plan this out Peter I know hobie's the ultimate supporter but I can't pretend like you don't secretly want miles to win and how much do we love that Miles just played dumb for a full 10 minutes tricking them into thinking he was just escaping only to outsmart all of them because they all constantly underestimate him nah I'm gonna do my own thing yep sorry I mean hell yes I taught him how to do that so I gotta be a pretty good Mentor might as well take the credit when you deserve it look I don't think it's supposed to be a huge mystery in reveal and I was gonna guess it anyway but showing Earth 42 like this is my only complaint about the ending possibly about the whole movie Vibes still them Vibes [Music] that line is flat out haunting we are and that line calls for this you sure about that you sure about that I've had the right amount of you got him perfect physical representation of how miles is feeling emotionally even though he isn't in Earth 65. pretty sure he doesn't have to do it that way he's just extra as hell badass bad guy badass current bad guy it's a little risky for Peter and MJ to have a Spider-Man mug no I'll take it off their hands easy to forget that Gwen's got that strength since usually she's more about style and precision and then she throws a codex box across the roof the art of the different spider folks against three different cityscapes here is gorgeous clearly the character design is killer but the film goes above and beyond with its location art spider ham Jimmy Jams might seem funny because it's penguin but she shot it out of his hand because based on their last interaction she was worried he had a gun brutal there's so many amazing shots here it's hard to keep track but I love how her colors are skewed through the glass on the table again interesting color palette choices of pink white and blue when Gwen says the only people she loves the most can only know half of who she is oh she did the Scorpion get over here thing but with love it's also so bright now that the air is cleared and they're seeing each other also so hugging I think that this thing is supposed to help I'll be and we saw him taking the parts for this which again makes me love Hobie even more because his whole vibe is I'm just messing stuff up but that's just what he wants everyone to think it's actually all thought out he knew he was quitting and he wasn't just being the Joker and creating chaos by encouraging miles to stand up for himself he's being zero cool and legitimately fighting the power while convincing us he don't give in it he couldn't support those Anarchist see and I knew mile should have done those shrooms before he left oh dang is that the first real hint vulture Telecom since the Sinister Six crime cartels control everything and then Khan Electro a power company I assume and that's soda coca not coca soda like in 1610 also Sony electronics and never 21 everything is Bleak in Earth 42. Phantom is now the Sandman also scorp also there was a joke among the writers and directors that Miles 42 was actually Wiles like Wario you know so you get Book of Mormon and W and W's Target is Mysterio this movie Sometimes feels like the Return of the King of false endings you guys okay and if you blinked when the 42 was on screen those of us paying attention now are starting to clue in I love how the Silence of the Lamb's moment also parallels the first time it seemed like Gwen was staring right at miles but really she wasn't the pretend whips although it doesn't matter now that I knew he wasn't actually home the piece of music that kicks in here gives us chills and sort of makes you want to cover your face and look through your fingers that's fair question are you sure you woke up oh that's dark wow that's a sneaky match cut look at them overlaid on each other who's in the wrong Universe spidey sense through Dimensions also that's somehow the most spine chilling line ever just the slightest hint of the prowler theme do what it's honestly good to be reminded that it's still the same day which is crazy it's a crazy long day even stairwells are purple for Prowler well without a spidey stuff Burns I guess ah two more Rhino casino and Sandman slots and Resort we'll always be sad that our buddy paper boy is gone in this world but it's a particular mural thinking maybe his spidey sense doesn't go off because it's him not that jewelry is the end-all be-all determiner of wealth but Rio and Earth 1610 has quite a lot on in Rio and Earth 42 where Jeff is dead does not again dark maybe we just gotta let him spread his wings man oh man he's taking advice from Spider-Man his own son you gotta let him spread his wings man like this well that's his jacket emo where's model did he just call her emo are there emo Zoomers I mean like the real kind of emo and my gatekeeping emo now makes sense that Miles 42 time mile 1610 up just like miles 1610 tied Peter up in the first movie the shadows in Earth 42 are just so dang black and Aaron's phone seems to have a bubbly almost spray paint effect to its glow also that he punched the CMYK right out of the bag rarely has such a scary moment been so artistically beautiful cartel seriously there are no other J Jonas also another Smart Touch for the Spider-Man last Universe The Sinister Six are now individual cartels rather than a team who are who are I'm Miles Morales I take it back it's still such a sick reveal oh cool like things weren't bad enough at least his artist a little killer no filler pretty much Jude's favorite scene right there Luis is just pointing Gwen's drums kicking as she appears damn straight Spider Girl and as much as I'm a sucker for a dire ending like this I love that we get just like three frames of the corner of miles's lip turning up as he charges his Venom strike me yeah I'm in and just some straight up James Bond intro credits all right Robin and who knows if it'll stay but love that across has blue and red and Beyond his purple and blue for Prowler visuals are stunning the stories engrossing the voice acting is over the top excellent the character animations while still beautifully stylized always feel like real people with real facial expressions and mannerisms or quirks there aren't characters that feel out of place or like they don't belong well except this kid that was in the first movie too speaking of which it's too early to say which movie I prefer but right now it's close it's close on Vibes alone across has taken it for me The Vibes are just right for me spider-gwents for swing after we spend eight minutes with how hard Gwen's life is and she just seems free and alive and happy and just where she wants to be and then the mirror of that when Rio releases miles to go after Gwen and then highlight kicks in and even though everything is going wrong for him right now whipping around New York City at night it's just like a rare moment for a Spider-Man movie we're given these moments of reflection that aren't just a dude sitting on top of a building staring at the Horizon they happen while the story is still moving now that the slowdowns aren't also some of my favorite scenes this right here is way up the top of my list but doing many things at the same time might be the movie's biggest strength it's never just a fight it's never just a game it's never just a speech and yeah when you land Oscar Isaac it's gonna be good he's gonna be funny and scary and you're gonna love hate him but no one is outclassed I joked about forgetting spot which I actually think he's deliberately pushed to the back burner but the darkness that he exudes and the chaos that he does with even the animation style of the movie pave the perfect Gene Spidey Miguel the brooding vampire Spidey hope Hobie Daniel kaluya helped write lines for Hobie and it shows he feels so at home in the character shamik Moore and Haley Steinfeld have chemistry that burned through the dang screen I don't think I could ever say enough good about shamique because he took that newbie unsure of himself energy from the first movie and turned it into something new and confident in this one without losing what made him likable before and I'm gonna say it again dropping actor names feels redundant because even the smaller parts like Shea wiggum's Captain Stacy sells every scene he's in Luna Lauren Velez gives one of the most meaningful and heartfelt mom talks ever and I hated laguerta fun fact her twin sister Lorraine Velez plays her sister Maria at the party Jake Johnson Issa Bray right down to Jarrell Jerome who had what 30 words I believe him I'm scared of him for mile 1610 and I can't wait to get more of him but enough about the surface stuff let's talk about some themes themes my friends let's talk about the black Spider-Man and how this movie made him the anomaly I mean clearly there are other black spider people and even Miguel O'Hara Irish huh well yes he is but also Mexican right the point is that the backlash to miles is unique in this world and I love how this movie just throws it out there it makes it part of the story the guy who seems to always know what he's talking about said that spin shouldn't exist so who are we to doubt him it seems like a clear response to the reactions that both comic miles and into the spider-verse miles received and Lord Miller didn't dance around it they came out and said it I have predictions about where beyond the spider-verse will take miles with his Canon events but I'm gonna keep them out of this video there's one other thing I want to talk about and that's the idea that a big part of Spider-Man's ethos is that he never wants to let anyone die so I could see people getting a little irked that Hobie and Miles seem to be the only ones who feel that way and apparently every other Spidey is on board with what Miguel is planning there are two main reasons that it doesn't bother me and why I think it works first is that with the exception of Gwen's dad dying the Canon events all happened for each Spidey before joining Miguel that was the biggest reason they wanted to keep miles away because once you know you're going to do everything you can but if you don't know then it's gonna happen and I think it's safe to say that Gwen was on the fence about what she was going to do and even question Miguel at the end maybe she didn't know the exact time like miles did and also they were basically estranged at that point so the idea of trying to protect him while he's hunting her would be kind of tricky the second reason is that well Miguel's story is believable I personally think he's lying again not going to get into the specifics but they've all seen a universe collapse and they have no reason to doubt the reason for it he even confirms with Peter B so it's not that they're all okay with the deaths in these Canon events it's that when weighed against entire universes it's not that simple and I think that part of the reason it's a little easier for miles is that he's already an anomaly and also spot is threatening to destroy his Universe anyway so why not try to stop him my point in all of this is that I can understand why it might make you do a double take but no spider person is perfect and we're still missing a lot of the puzzle pieces so whether Miguel is straight up lying or has well-meaning intentions but just doesn't know what he's talking about I think our guy will find a way around it I'm not saying that Miles isn't going to go through tragedy he already lost uncle Aaron I'm also not saying that his dad will necessarily live what I'm saying is that miles is gonna do his own thing and I fully support him in that one of the main message of the first movie was that anyone could put on the mask it just took a leap of faith and now Miguel is saying there are certain things written in stone that you just don't change or it all falls apart it's a great setup for the right message with a dilemma that isn't that easy to solve at first glance I mean most of what I've said has taken it for granted that Miles saving his dad won't unravel the universe but that's also not a guarantee and that's really what Spider-Man is about what it's always been about making the tough calls and dealing with the consequences it's actually impressive that this entire movie is just one big Cliffhanger for how that plays out oh dang it spot I always forget about spot which is weird because he gives me the Beast vibes from Infamous and I can never forget him it'll be interesting to see how they wrap this up and I'm excited for it and next week back to Blood and Guts see that we did pushing boots chill movie

[Audience murmurs] You're serious, aren't you? You're telling us you killed those three young men on the subway? Hm-hmm. And why should we believe you? I ain't got nothing left to lose. Nothing can hurt me anymore. [Chuckles] My life is nothing but a comedy. [Audience murmuring and booing] Let me get this straight. You think that killing those guys is funny? I do. And I'm tired of pretending it's not. Comedy is subjective, Murray. Isn't it what they say? All of you... the system that knows so much... you decide what's right or wrong? The same way that you decide what's funny, or not. Audience member: Get him off! Okay, I think I might understand that you... did this to start a movement? To become a symbol? Come on, Murray... Do I look like the kind of clown that could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody is awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy. Murray: Okay, so that's it. You're crazy. That's your defense for killing three young men? Nah. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. [Audience booing] Oh, why is everybody so upset about these guys? If it was me dying on the sidewalk, you'd walk right over me! I pass you every day and you don't notice me but these guys, what, because Thomas Wayne went and cried about them on TV? - You have a problem with Thomas Wayne too? 
- Yes, I do. Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore! Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy! You think men like Thomas Wayne ever think what it's like to be someone like me? To be somebody but themselves? They don't. They think that we'll just sit there and take it like good little boys. That we won't werewolf and go wild! You finished? I mean, it's so much self-pity, Arthur. You sound like you're making excuses for killing those young men! Not everybody, and I'll tell you this, not everyone is awful. You're awful, Murray. Murray: Me? I'm awful? Oh yeah, how am I awful? Playing my video. Inviting me on the show. You just wanted to make fun of me. You're just like the rest of them! You don't know the first thing about me, pal. Look what happened because of what you did, what it led to. There are riots out there. Two policemen are in critical condition, and you're laughing, you're laughing. Someone was killed today because of what you did. I know! - How about another joke, Murray?
- No, I think we've had enough of your jokes. - What do you get...
Murray: I don't think so. ...when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash!? - Call the police, Gene, call the police.

After his father passes away, Ith opens a mysterious package delivered to his house. He accidentally turns on and pairs with a state-of-the-art robot doll. Uncle Jean, the robot’s creator, says the student needs to use the doll in order for the investors to approve mass production. Since he’s already paired with the robot, no one else can fulfill the objective. If he fails, they’ll have to pay back 50 million baht to each investors. However, Ith's inexperience severely complicates matters.

https://linktr.ee/youtubermastery","An inexperienced university student accidentally
pairs with a pleasure doll, and he must sleep with the robot, or else, incur a massive 50
million baht debt. One night, Ith curiously wanders around the
house, trying to figure out where a strange noise is coming from. Eventually, he opens a door, where he sees
a masked man receiving pleasure from a woman. The frightening figure approaches the boy
and gives him a menacing look. Finally, Ith wakes from the scary recurring
dream when he loudly passes gas. His father, Mr. Nuay, an adult film star,
enters the room to tell him to keep the noise down. Moments later, Mr. Nuay returns to his film
shoot, which Ith can clearly hear from the adjacent room. Suddenly, the older man perishes from a heart
attack in the middle of filming. While the paramedics wheel the teen’s father
onto the ambulance, his friend Lisa comforts him. In the ensuing days, the newspapers published
tribute articles for the deceased adult film star. One morning, Ith finds a large box by his
front gate from the Jean Claude Lab. After carrying it into the house, it suddenly
vibrates, and Ith wonder what it could be. So, he opens the package, and carefully sifts
through the packing peanuts, exposing a woman’s chest. He touches the item, but a person’s hand
grabs his wrist. The frightened teen backs away, and a scantily-clad,
beautiful woman pops out of the box. In Japanese, she introduces herself as Anna,
and says she’ll do whatever he wants. Overwhelmed, Ith passes gas, a reflex that
unconsciously happens whenever he’s excited. He scrambles out of the house and runs into
his father’s friend, Uncle Jean, a scientist. The older man frantically asks the teen if
he opened the package, and if he touched the robot’s chest. Before he can answer, Anna catches up to him,
and starts touching his body suggestively. The scientist instructs him to exclaim the
code word to temporarily disable the robot. Minutes later, Jean explains that Anna is
a pleasure doll prototype who runs on an artificial intelligence program he and Ith’s father
developed. He says that the robot was sent to the house
for the adult film star to test out, because they had planned to present it to the investors. However, now the Mr. Nuay has passed, and
the teen paired with it, much like a mobile phone only recognizes its owner’s fingerprint,
the scientist can no longer take it back. Confused, Ith asks what he’s supposed to
do, and Jean says he has to sleep with it, to prove to investors that it works. When Ith refuses, the older man reveals they’ll
have to pay back the investors 50 million baht each. Jean assures him that he only has to sleep
with Anna once, and all their problems are solved. However, the teen recalls a moment in the
school restroom, where a female student touches him and says she’d like to sleep with him. Unfortunately, Ith’s gas reflex turns the
woman off, and two male classmates make fun of him for his inability to live up to his
father’s reputation as an experienced lover. Eventually, the scientist hands him the product
manual, and reminds him to change the language to Thai, so he and the doll can communicate. As the man leaves, he checks his tablet from
Anna’s point-of-view, and sees the teen reading the manual. Minutes later, Ith rubs Anna’s backside
to access her settings, and successfully changes her language to Thai. Now that they can communicate, the teen asks
how much battery she has left, so Anna shows the 94% reading on her inner thigh. When he asks if she can use up her energy
doing any strenuous activity, the robot confirms. So, he orders her to perform several different
exercises, such as bouncing on a medicine ball, aerobics, and a roller wheel. Suddenly, she states that she’s at 5% power,
before shutting down. Ith approaches the doll, and notes that she’s
overheated. Then, he covers her up with a blanket, and
gets dressed for school. After the student leaves, Jean sneaks into
the house to install a longer lasting battery into Anna. Minutes later, he programs the doll to go
and find the teen in the university. So, Anna sprints towards the school, and every
person she passes is in awe of her beauty. In the classroom, Ith’s friends Penguin,
Pop, and Lisa argue about their film project. Suddenly, Anna enters the room, forcing the
embarrassed student to introduce her as his distant relative. The instantly enamored Penguin and Pop ask
the woman if she’s an actress or a model, while Lisa annoyedly wonders why he’s never
mentioned Anna, despite them being friends since childhood. After class, the female friend admonishes
Pop for disrespectfully staring at Anna’s chest. Seconds later, Rattana and the rest of the
Thai Values Conservation Club reprimand Anna for wearing a revealing version of the school
uniform. To get her to stop, Pop playfully steals her
glasses, and demands that she asks politely to get them back. Flustered, the club president does as he says. After the confrontation, Ith’s friends realize
that he and Anna are gone. When they leave, Rattana vows to make the
rulebreakers repent for their transgressions. Elsewhere, the teen says he needs to get home,
so the robot tells him to get on her back, and she carries him home. In the house, Ith thanks the doll, then asks
how she recharged her battery. Anna says Jean replaced her battery with one
that no longer overheats or shuts down easily. When he asks where her battery is stored,
she starts unbuttoning her blouse, so the teen tells her to stop. At that precise moment, Lisa arrives, and
says she was right to think that they aren’t really related. All of a sudden, the robot spreads her legs
to show them where her battery is located, shocking Ith and Lisa. Minutes later, the teen explains the situation
to his friend, who suggests he should just have Pop or Penguin sleep with the robot. However, he says Anna has a safety protection
system installed, which means she’ll attack anyone who isn’t her owner. Skeptical, Lisa tries to touch the doll’s
chest, but she's electrocuted. That night, Anna tries to sleep with the teen
when she calculates that there’s a 75% chance of it happening. However, when she gets under the covers to
pleasure him, it upsets his stomach and he remembers his recurring dream with the masked
man. Before things escalate, the robot malfunctions
and freezes, allowing Ith to move away from her. The next day, the scientist realizes he’ll
need help encouraging Ith to gain confidence with women. So, he calls up Saeng Dao, a retired adult
film star, to teach their old friend’s son her world-renowned lovemaking skills. Despite her successful hand washing laundry
business, the woman accepts the challenge. Later that day, Saeng Dao makes her way to
Ith’s home, and all the men she encounters are left speechless as she passes by. Meanwhile, Anna boots up in the bedroom, and
announces that her system’s been upgraded. In the living room, the woman gets emotional
when talking about Ith’s late father. Then she asks if his condition where he passes
gas whenever excited still happens, and he confirms. So, Saeng Dao instructs him to repeat phrases
of affirmation to encourage him not to be afraid of being with a woman, before taking
his hands and placing them on her chest. Suddenly, Anna appears from behind the couch,
and karate chops the woman’s neck. Minutes later, the visibly pained woman tells
Ith to call her whenever he needs advice, careful not to touch him, lest the robot hit
her again. As she leaves, she calls up the scientist
to inform him that she failed her objective. Then, Lisa arrives with a full face of makeup,
while wearing a skimpier uniform. At school, Rattana intercepts Lisa and Anna
and demands that they change their clothes, to Pop and Penguin’s dismay. In film class, the teacher informs them that
the Thai Values Conservation Club president approached him to task the group with making
a film about the dangers of pleasurable activities before marriage. At first, the group refuses, but the teacher
says the film can serve as their final project, and promises to give them A’s if they do
a good job. Rattana also says she’ll be overseeing the
group to make sure they don’t mess it up. Later, the group heads to Ith’s house because
he already has the equipment in his late father’s studio, and he begs Lisa not to tell them
about Anna’s true nature. Outside the gate, they spot Saeng Dao, whom
Penguin immediately recognizes, and promptly introduces himself to. In the studio, Ith’s friends are in awe
of the unusual toys and props littered around the space. Soon, the group discusses the basic story
of the film, and the woman says she doesn’t understand why it’s necessary to promote
no pleasurable activities before marriage. She thinks it’s better to advocate for safe
and responsible lovemaking. Suddenly, Ith says they should probably conclude
today’s meeting, since he feels everyone else isn’t taking the project seriously. That night, the robot entices the teen to
sleep with her, but he ignores the advances and concentrates on schoolwork. When she asks what’s bothering him, he shares
his worries regarding the 50 million baht debt, which he blames his father for. He says people think having the most famous
adult film star for a father is cool, when it’s actually the opposite. Anna asks what kind of father Mr. Nuay was,
and Ith says he was a great father, but sometimes felt the man was only making up for all the
bad things he’d done. However, he emphasizes that despite his father’s
shortcomings, he always loved him. The robot remarks that she has a difficult
time understanding love, so the teen explains that a person truly loves someone when they
learn to accept both their good and bad qualities. Then, she processes the emotion, and saves
it into her system. He asks if she’s able to develop feelings,
and she’s hopeful she’ll use them just like a real person would, in the future. The next day, during filming, Lisa secretly
spreads lubricant on the floor before calling the robot over. However, Rattana comes running toward her,
and she slips on the substance. Unfortunately, the doll freezes when the fall
damages her head, and the concerned Ith quickly sees if she’s alright. That night, he calls up Jean to ask for help,
and the scientist advises him to restart the robot and ask it to reorganize its data. Minutes later, Anna turns back on and says
she’s alright. She asks if Lisa did what she did because
she hates her, but the teen thinks his friend didn’t mean to hurt Anna, and that even
though she may seem arrogant, she’s actually a kind person. Then, the doll asks if he loves Lisa, and
Ith says he loves her as a friend, and is thankful for her being by his side during
the toughest moments of his life. He recalls his friend comforting him after
the classmates bullied him in the restroom. So, Anna states that since she still feels
happy being around the teen despite his different moods, she asks if what she feels is love. She also asks him how he feels about her. Instead of answering her questions, the flustered
Ith simply says that she’s a much better communicator after she reorganized her data. When he gets up to leave, she asks him to
stay by her side while she charges her battery, and the pair cuddle in bed. The next morning, he’s shocked to find the
robot in the shower while wearing a revealing bikini. She explains that she showers twice a day
because hygiene is important. Excited, the teen remembers his frightening
dream, before running out of the bathroom. In the girls’ restroom, Lisa apologizes
to Anna, and the doll says she isn’t mad. When the human asks why she isn’t angry,
the robot plays the conversation she had with Ith last night, where he says Lisa is a kind
person. Then, she recalls the first time she met the
teen. He saved her from a crude flasher by kicking
the man in the groin, and she thanks him and introduces herself. Lisa says Ith has always protected her, and
the reason she’s strong is because he always tells her to be strong. Suddenly, the robot processes the concept
of friendship into her system, but the human corrects her and says that she loves Ith. Before she leaves, Lisa reiterates that she
and Anna are enemies both vying for the same person. That night, the doll wears a black outfit
with leather straps, and entices the teen again. When she realizes he’s too busy with schoolwork,
she begins cleaning his room, making sure that he sees her bending over. Then, she calculates his lovemaking probability
at 85%, so he thinks they should give it a try. However, her aggressive approach causes him
to finish early, and the embarrassed teen walks out of the room. The next day, Pop brings alcohol to their
group meeting. Lisa knows he plans to get Anna drunk, and
encourages him to push through with it. Many drinks later, Saeng Dao steps out for
a moment, and the others tell Penguin to make sure she's alright. Seconds later, Lisa tells Ith that she doesn’t
feel well and wants to lie down on his bed, and the concerned teen follows her. When the robot stands to join them, Pop stops
her and tells her to stay. He explains that Lisa and Ith always flirt
when they’ve had too much to drink, and tells the doll that they can stay and have
fun. In the bedroom, the friend pins the teen down
on the bed and begins unbuttoning her blouse. He tells her to stop, and says they’re just
friends, but she continues to inch her face closer to his. In the studio, Pop tells Anna that Ith likes
women who drink, so the robot grabs the bottle and chugs it down. The liquid causes her to malfunction and freeze,
and the teen takes it as an opportunity to sleep with her. From his lab, Jean is alerted that someone
else is touching the robot, so he calls Ith. In the bedroom, Lisa tries to kiss the teen,
but he evades her. When she tries to unbutton his pants, he pushes
her off him and answers his phone. The scientist tells him to find Anna immediately
because if anyone else sleeps with her, her safety protection system might end up killing
the person. Fortunately, the teen arrives in time to save
the robot from his friend. He admonishes Pop for only thinking about
sleeping with women all the time. The friend argues that him wanting to sleep
with a beautiful woman is normal, and Ith’s refusal to do so is strange. So, the teen reveals that Anna is a robot,
and Pop says he’ll take her if the teen doesn’t want her. Furious, he asks his friend if he has 50 million
baht, because he’ll gladly give him the robot to unburden himself. Realizing Anna heard his harsh words, Ith
tries to apologize, but the doll cries real tears and slaps him. Then, she runs out of the room, prompting
the sympathetic Lisa to order the teen to chase the robot. Outside, Anna sobs and wishes she wasn’t
able to feel sad emotions. Then, she runs into the street, where a vehicle
hits her. Soon, the scientist informs him that the robot’s
motherboard was severely damaged, and he’ll have to take her back to the lab. He adds that fixing the damage will most likely
wipe her memory clean, and she won’t remember him at all. Ith asks if the changes are necessary, and
the older man tells him to accept that everything is over, and apologizes for causing him all
the trouble. Later, Lisa and Penguin encourage the somber
teen to save Anna, so they head to Jean’s lab. However, just as the scientist predicted,
the robot has reverted to her factory settings, and no longer remembers him. The teen asks if there’s any other way to
retain her memories, and the older man says they could connect their brain waves, allowing
the person to delve into deeper memories. Despite the scientist’s warning about the
risky process, Ith is determined to proceed. While under, Ith finds himself inside his
mind, where he sees Anna walking away. He tries to follow her, but is transported
to his memory of the incident in the restroom. Instead of feeling embarrassed, he stands
up for himself against the bullies. Then, he ends up in the film studio, where
a chaotic scene tries to distract him from his mission. When he opens the next door, he reverts to
his childhood and sees the masked man. However, he realizes it was his father under
the scary mask this whole time. Finally, Ith finds the unconscious Anna lying
on a bed. He tells the robot that even though they’ve
only known each other a short time, he’s thankful that she came into his life. He says that even though he didn't always
treat her well, she always tried to understand him. He begs her to wake up so he can apologize
for the hurtful words he uttered. To his surprise, their plan worked, and the
doll wakes up and gives him a hug. Meanwhile, in the real world, Anna also holds
onto him in a warm embrace. Days later, Ith and the doll are still unsuccessful
at lovemaking, but the teen no longer needs to worry about the 50 million baht debt, because
an American producer approached him to buy the rights to all of his father’s movies. Pop and Rattana realized they’ve liked each
other from the beginning, and because of the latter’s strict vow of chastity, they’ve
resorted to incorporating pleasure toys for the time being. Penguin was also able to win over Saeng Dao,
and he helps out in her laundry business. Lisa continues to be wary of the robot, but
Ith believes she truly enjoys spending time with Anna. Jean concluded that his invention failed at
being a pleasure doll, lifting the pressure off the teen’s shoulders to have to sleep
with her. However, he and Anna spend all of their time
together, genuinely enjoying each other’s company. "

#ahsoka #starwars",the Ahsoka show is starting to prove that we're finally getting back to that creative fun George Lucas prequel era Star Wars which a lot of older fans might not resonate with some think Star Wars should be more gritty and serious more in line with the original trilogy which resulted in a sequel Trilogy that may have left a bad taste in your mouth if you're a prequel fan it truly felt like those movies actively ignored the prequels and the amazing world that George Lucas had built up but so far into Ahsoka a show that is set roughly around the same time we still get those prequel Vibes a very Phantom menace-esque intro references like malls tracker hyper space Rings the headsets that the Jedi used to have General hu Yang including very similar prequel music Vibes specifically from The Phantom Menace in this instance [Music] [Applause] oh I really feel that we have a true prequel fan at the helm of live action Star Wars now that results in creative and Incredibly fun scenes like Ahsoka going for a spacewalk and slicing ships in half very reminiscent of Clone Wars all this while still paying great respect to the originals with a blind saber training the Tie Fighter attack in mon mothma back in the same briefing room from Return of the Jedi

#shorts #StarWars #ahsoka",this is actually so messed up so what a lot of people don't realize about Anakin in the Clone Wars is that during this first flashback in Ahsoka even though Anakin looks like a full adult he's only 19 years of age this was his age when the Clone Wars first started and his age during the movie and first season of The Clone Wars and being only 19 years of age and thrust into war comes with a lot of responsibility not to mention Ahsoka his new Apprentice at this point is only 14 years old so you basically got a 19 year old looking after a 14 year old during the middle of a galactic war and when you think about Anakin's Journey like this the fact he lost his mother at a young age the fact he also lost his father figure in Qui-Gon it's not so hard to see the reasons for him turning to the dark side

6:14 Worst Change!",the one piece live action Series has proven to be the first to break free from the curse that has plagued to live action anime adaptations for years giving us anime fans a reprieve and hope for a better future regarding live action adaptations while the live-action show was a huge success and is currently rated number one in 84 different countries on Netflix there were certain changes made to the show that I couldn't help but notice as they did not make all that much sense to me number one alvita's casting and character I don't really understand what they were thinking when they cast Ilya Paulino as alvida in both the Manga and Anime olvita is a very heavy set character not only is Elia Paulino way too pretty for the role of alvita but she also doesn't have the noticeable pounds that the character is known for that is free weight loss of course also in the anime alvita's character is one who sees herself as the most beautiful woman in all the Seas despite how she looks so it was a huge shock to fans when alvita lost weight and actually became pretty however in the show you don't really get to see that narcissistic behavior and that's probably because they made her too pretty so it wouldn't make much sense for her to keep praising herself for her beauty although the evil queen from Snow White didn't let that stop her if this change annoyed you wait until you see what they did in the tenth one it will have you grinding your teeth number two garp's early appearance in the live action the story of GARP and the Marines was introduced very early in the live-action series whereas GARP is not seen until the 68th episode in the anime and in the manga he doesn't interact with Luffy and his crew until chapter 431 now although I understood that the show wanted us to see Luffy's determination to be a pirate despite his grandfather's disapproval in episode 8 when GARP finally catches up to Luffy it is revealed that it was a test to see if he really wanted to be a pirate I don't know about you but that felt very unsatisfying to watch I mean the dude chased him for the entire Eight Episodes only for it all to be a test another shock was the show giving garpa very noticeable Scottish accent number three Luffy vs alvita's Pirates in the live action we see Luffy's Barrel slowly making its way towards the two ships fighting and then Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo the barrel is inside alvida's ship however in the anime we actually get to see how Luffy's Barrel is brought aboard although as you can see the fight scenes happen in broad daylight in the anime but in the live action the whole scene including the fight between Luffy and alvita takes place at night I'm sure this change happens because it's much easier to conceal things like CGI mistakes in the dark just ask the experts of fight scenes taking place in the dark DC number four zoro's rice ball scene at shellstown in the live action Zorro encounters a creepy little girl who just randomly offers him chocolate rice balls hell mepo steps on the rice balls and Chaos ensues look I understand what they were trying to do they wanted to show zoro's caring side and not just the cold character they initially presented however in this particular context it Felts off to me because it doesn't really make much sense in the anime Zora was already arrested by the Marines because he saved the little girl from helmeppo's vicious pet as a way to thank him she offered him rice balls after he had been starved for several days the anime portrayed zoro's compassionate side in a way that made much better sense than what was shown in the live action number five zoro's fight scene with kabaji I remember seeing this scene and thinking oh here we go I was so ready for Zorro and kabaji to have a go at it especially considering that kabaji had a beef to settle with Zora however in the live action nearly nothing comes with the confrontation as Zorro just chokes kabaji if I hadn't watched the anime I might not have minded all that much but the fact that they took out what had been an epic fight between Zorro and kabaji like in the anime was just plain wrong number six Chow Chow the sixth crime committed by the show is almost as bad as the 10th on the list they got rid of The Lovable Brave dog chow chow and no those two seconds they gave him in the live action do not count we don't get to see Chow Chow who defended his late owner's Pet Shop even if it meant getting hurt we don't get to see Chow Chow blocking the path so that Luffy and the straw hats crew could escape from the angry mob the show just reduced him to being a random dog in Orange town number seven nami's fight scenes I won't lie I half expected the show to turn Nami into a total girl boss who doesn't need any man to help her or follow the generic garbage plot where the female lead is somehow better and stronger than her male counterpart so while I was thankful that the show didn't exactly go down that route they certainly portrayed Nami as a far better fighter than I remember from the earlier episodes of One Piece Nami was not the formidable fighter that the live-action made her out to be number eight arlong while I really enjoyed McKinley Belcher III's portrayal of arlong the character itself was not what I was expecting in the anime arlong is well over eight feet tall and though I understand that realistically they wouldn't be able to cast such a person for the role I at least expected someone bigger and taller to play Arlon also I don't understand why he is so decently dressed in the live action did they not want to spend more money on whatever makeup or effects they needed to make his chest better resemble the anime number nine our Long Park fight the whole point of the r long Pirates is that they were much more stronger underwater as fishmen so it seemed pretty stupid that the show didn't show the Fishman fight underwater or at least have the Fishman drag the straw hats crew into the water when they noticed they were getting beaten by just two teenage kids in the fight between Luffy and arlong would have been so much better if it had happened underwater because Luffy in the live action was just mostly jumping around during the fighting scenes this to me was the worst change Netflix made to the series number 10 reducing Don krieg's scene reduced heck they decimated his character in the live action he is only shown for a handful of minutes when mihawk finishes him off and that's it that's all we get to see of Don Krieg in the entire Eight Episodes of the series killing off his character felt like a crime in the anime Don Krieg was the main antagonist at the Bara T not arlong there we get to see Luffy and Sanji really develop his characters during the fight with Don Creek with gin being an important part of the story as he stood up against on creep but since Don Krieg was heartlessly cut out from the picture we couldn't expect to see again either and because of this decision that the show made we don't get to see the same level of character development as we did in the anime let me know in the comments if you noticed any other questionable changes made in the live action and don't forget to like And subscribe to my channel

Man, I LOVE editing trailers lol

I'll always prefer the old animation style, but I wanted more scenes to choose from, so I went with the anime specials - Episode of Nami, Episode of East Blue, and Episode of Merry. I also used One Piece movie 5 + some random filler episodes with reanimated east blue content, hence the different art styles in every shot lol. It's not exactly a 1:1 recreation of the Netflix trailer, though I followed it pretty closely. 


I own nothing. This is a fanmade trailer for entertainment only.",well babe power I found everything in this world has to offer [Applause] free yourselves paint to the Seas my treasure is yours to find so what do you say are you with me [Music] why would anyone want to be a pirate which is the best thing there is and then you're back [Applause] salt is here loyal crew by your side it's right what is it or Jolly Roger we are the straw hat crew [Music] we're heading up to the Grand line treacherous stretch of ocean with bigger islands anchor Pirates that's where we're gonna find the one piece we've been making enemies everywhere we go Luffy they are hunting you [Music] guys save your ass well I saved yours you'll have to excuse them they're idiots [Music] our crew can handle anything [Music] I'll do you the kindness of killing you all together you're my captain from now until the end [Music] I'm gonna kick your ass cause no one messes with my friends what's so special about you I'm Monkey D loopy and I'm gonna be king of the Pirates [Music]

Lyrics: 
Can anybody stop this feeling
Can anybody stop this pain
Stop this world from turning
So we can start it again again again again yeah

Tell me that I’m just dreaming
Don’t tell me we’ve gone too far
Tell me this life has a meaning            
Is it written in all our scars

Never gonna turn it back
Never gonna change the facts
Can’t stop this world from turning
The fire’s already burning
Never gonna feel the same
Never gonna and that’s a shame
We gotta keep believing
Can’t lose that human feeling

If anybody has the answer
The question’s never in doubt
Some say life is a dancer
Together we’ll find out

Tell me it’s just a feeling
Tell me that this ain’t real 
It’s an artificial dream of the future
We’d better be prepared to kneel

Never gonna turn it back
Never gonna change the facts
Can’t stop this world from turning
The fire’s already burning
Never gonna feel the same
Never gonna and that’s a shame
We gotta keep believing
Can’t lose that human feeling

I don’t think I can make it
If you won’t tell me the truth
No I don’t think I can fake it
If you’re keeping secrets too 
No I don’t think I can make it
No matter how hard I try
I don’t think I can shake this feeling 
That everything I know is a lie   

Never gonna turn it back
Never gonna change the facts
Can’t stop this world from turning
The fire’s already burning
Never gonna feel the same
Never gonna and that’s a shame
We gotta keep believing
Can’t lose that human feeling
        
Tell me it’s it just a feeling
What’s the meaning
Tell me that this ain’t real
What’s the meaning

Tell me it’s it just a feeling
What’s the meaning
Tell me that this ain’t real
Come on tell me that this ain’t real

#rickastley #rickroll #memes",Rick Astley has officially released a sequel to his iconic 1987 hit Never Gonna Give You Up perhaps one of the most famous songs in the world at this point due to its consistent presence in meme culture this sequel is called Never Gonna Stop and showcases the man's excellent voice in a song all about staying human in a world that constantly threatens to make it difficult to do so Rick wrote in the comments my wife Lena and I shot this video on a phone in Denmark in a forest beside a beautiful beach the song in essence is about how there is so much technology out there pulling and pushing us in our daily lives that we need to remain human in this fast-moving world the idea of making a video Simply somewhere beautiful and real like this resonates with me and I hope it does with you too it's a somewhat cliched statement about technology affecting human life but man I cannot agree with it more humans are biological which means we are inefficient messy and emotional and sometimes technology especially social media is incredibly good at exploiting that until we are led by the nose by algorithms as such It's always important to take a step back from social media and remind oneself that it isn't all there is to life which is an attitude that Rick took after exploding into stardom whilst he was young after reaching incredible Heights as a singer from the late 80s to early 90s he actually retired at 27 years old to focus on family life and dipped out of the spotlight that is something worth a ton of respect and his return in the early 2000s led to the unmanageably popular wreck-rolling Trend blasting him back into the world as a household name he has since totally embraced the meme especially in 2020 when he was Rick Rolled by a fan tricking him into clicking a link to his own song disguised as a picture of a backstage meeting Rick Astley is touring later in the year so if you're a die-hard fan and you'd like to catch him live there's still time fans of Never Gonna Give You Up may be interested to find Rick has also long since moved from dance pop to salt and his iconic deep voice is absolutely perfectly suited to the job whilst only two singles never gonna stop and dip in my feet have released from his new album are we there yet so far the entire variety of it comes out next month so keep an eye out for some cool Tunes in short it's awesome to see a humble man who left the spotlight to focus on his family continue to reach unparalleled success in part due to meme culture and as such his sequel to Never Gonna Give You Up deserves every listen what mean would you guys like me to give a lesson in next let me know in the comments below I remember like and subscribe or else
